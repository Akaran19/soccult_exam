Its introduction in 1959 by Pierre-Paul Grassé made it possible to explain what had been until then considered paradoxical observations: In an insect society individuals work as if they were alone while their collective activities appear to be coordinated. In this article we describe the history of stigmergy in the context of social insects and discuss the general properties of two distinct stigmergic mechanisms: quantitative stigmergy and qualitative stigmergy. © 1999 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.,Coordination | Self-assembling | Self-organization | Social insects | Stigmergy,455.0,0.0,,,,undefined,,Social and Cultural dynamics,

Instead of understanding symptoms as indicators of an underlying common cause, this approach suggests symptoms co-occur in syndromes due to causal interactions. The current study has two goals: (1) examine the network structure among the 20 DSM-5 PTSD symptoms, and (2) incorporate clinically relevant variables to the network to investigate whether PTSD symptoms exhibit differential relationships with suicidal ideation, depression, anxiety, physical functioning/quality of life (QoL), mental functioning/QoL, age, and sex. Method We utilized a nationally representative U.S. military veteran's sample; and analyzed the data from a subsample of 221 veterans who reported clinically significant DSM-5 PTSD symptoms. Networks were estimated using state-of-the-art regularized partial correlation models. Data and code are published along with the paper. Results The 20-item DSM-5 PTSD network revealed that symptoms were positively connected within the network. Especially strong connections emerged between nightmares and flashbacks; blame of self or others and negative trauma-related emotions, detachment and restricted affect; and hypervigilance and exaggerated startle response. The most central symptoms were negative trauma-related emotions, flashbacks, detachment, and physiological cue reactivity. Incorporation of clinically relevant covariates into the network revealed paths between self-destructive behavior and suicidal ideation; concentration difficulties and anxiety, depression, and mental QoL; and depression and restricted affect. Conclusion These results demonstrate the utility of a network approach in modeling the structure of DSM-5 PTSD symptoms, and suggest differential associations between specific DSM-5 PTSD symptoms and clinical outcomes in trauma survivors. Implications of these results for informing the assessment and treatment of this disorder, are discussed.",Depression | DSM-5 | Functioning | Network analysis | PTSD | Quality of life (QoL) | Suicide | Veterans,217.0,0.0,repositoryam,Green,ERC,647209,European Research Council,Social and Cultural dynamics,

Symptoms that connect two mental disorders are called ""bridge symptoms."" Unfortunately, no formal quantitative methods for identifying these bridge symptoms exist. Accordingly, we developed four network statistics to identify bridge symptoms: bridge strength, bridge betweenness, bridge closeness, and bridge expected influence. These statistics are nonspecific to the type of network estimated, making them potentially useful in individual-level psychometric networks, group-level psychometric networks, and networks outside the field of psychopathology such as social networks. We first tested the fidelity of our statistics in predicting bridge nodes in a series of simulations. Averaged across all conditions, the statistics achieved a sensitivity of 92.7% and a specificity of 84.9%. By simulating datasets of varying sample sizes, we tested the robustness of our statistics, confirming their suitability for network psychometrics. Furthermore, we simulated the contagion of one mental disorder to another, showing that deactivating bridge nodes prevents the spread of comorbidity (i.e., one disorder activating another). Eliminating nodes based on bridge statistics was more effective than eliminating nodes high on traditional centrality statistics in preventing comorbidity. Finally, we applied our algorithms to 18 group-level empirical comorbidity networks from published studies and discussed the implications of this analysis.",bridge nodes | comorbidity | Graph theory | network analysis | node centrality linear models | psychopathology,474.0,0.0,,,,undefined,,Social and Cultural dynamics,

We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them 'small-world' networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon13'14 (popularly known as six degrees of separation15). The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks.

This kind of coordination often permits group-living species to achieve collective tasks that are far beyond single individuals' capabilities. In particular, a key benefit lies in the integration of partial knowledge of the environment at the collective level. In this contribution, we discuss various self-organization phenomena in animal swarms and human crowds from the point of view of information exchange among individuals. In particular, we provide a general description of collective dynamics across species and introduce a classification of these dynamics not only with respect to the way information is transferred among individuals but also with regard to the knowledge processing at the collective level. Finally, we highlight the fact that the individual's ability to learn from past experiences can have a feedback effect on the collective dynamics, as experienced with the development of behavioral conventions in pedestrian crowds. © 2009 Cognitive Science Society, Inc.",Collective behaviors | Distributed cognition | Information transfer | Living beings | Self-organization | Social interactions,156.0,1.0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,,Social and Cultural dynamics,

We test our method on computer-generated and real-world graphs whose community structure is already known and find that the method detects this known structure with high sensitivity and reliability.

Distinct patterns of behavior characterize the lower-conflict subspace, including tit-for-tat reversion. While a fraction of the transitions between these subspaces are associated with top-down actions taken by administrators, the effects are weak. Surprisingly, we find no statistical signal that transitions are associated with the appearance of particularly anti-social users, and only weak association with significant news events outside the system. These findings are consistent with transitions being driven by decentralized processes with no clear locus of control. Models of belief revision in the presence of a common resource for information-sharing predict the existence of two distinct phases: a disordered high-conflict phase, and a frozen phase with spontaneously-broken symmetry.

Koch) (Araneae: Theridiidae). We determined that the spatial distribution of these two spiders was clumped and that H. thorelli had a greater tendency to aggregate than did A. tepidariorum. To determine the mechanism responsible for this spatial pattern, we conducted three field experiments. We examined web-site selection by H. thorelli in three contexts: no spiders or webs present (cue removed), vacant webs present, and occupied webs present. In the case where no webs were present, there was no tendency for spiders to choose previously occupied sites as web sites. When vacant webs were present, spiders chose to occupy the vacant webs. When occupied webs were present, spiders either invaded webs and evicted the owners, or settled adjacent to and attached their webs to those of residents. Various microhabitat variables (height, angle, temperature, humidity, and substrate character of the rock surface) of randomly selected unoccupied sites and the web sites chosen by spiders were compared. There were no detectable differences between web sites and unoccupied sites with respect to any of the variables measured. This leads us to conclude that web-site choice by immigrating spiders was based on the presence of silk rather than other features of the site.",,40.0,0.0,,,,undefined,,Social and Cultural dynamics,

However, research on creative exploration is limited by a lack of high-resolution automated paradigms. To address this, we present such an automated paradigm, the creative foraging game, in which people search for novel and valuable solutions in a large and well-defined space made of all possible shapes made of ten connected squares. Players discovered shape categories such as digits, letters, and airplanes as well as more abstract categories. They exploited each category, then dropped it to explore once again, and so on. Aligned with a prediction of optimal foraging theory (OFT), during exploration phases, people moved along meandering paths that are about three times longer than the shortest paths between shapes; when exploiting a category of related shapes, they moved along the shortest paths. The moment of discovery of a new category was usually done at a non-prototypical and ambiguous shape, which can serve as an experimental proxy for creative leaps. People showed individual differences in their search patterns, along a continuum between two strategies: a mercurial quick-to-discover/quick-to-drop strategy and a thorough slow-to-discover/slow-to-drop strategy. Contrary to optimal foraging theory, players leave exploitation to explore again far before categories are depleted.

The dictator, acting self-interestedly, should offer nothing to the anonymous second player, but in experimental studies, dictators offer much more than nothing. We developed a multilevel selection model to explain why people offer more than nothing in the dictator game. We show that fairness can evolve when population structure emerges from the aggregation and limited dispersal of offspring. We begin with an analytical model that shows how fair behavior can benefit groups by minimizing within-group variance in resources and thereby increasing group fitness. To investigate the generality of this result, we developed an agent-based model with agents that have no information about other agents. We allowed agents to aggregate into groups and evolve different levels of fairness by playing the dictator game for resources to reproduce. This allowed multilevel selection to emerge from the spatiotemporal properties of individual agents. We found that the population structure that emerged under low population densities was most conducive to the evolution of fairness, which is consistent with group selection as a major evolutionary force. We also found that fairness only evolves if resources are not too scarce relative to the lifespan of agents. We conclude that the evolution of fairness could evolve under multilevel selection. Thus, our model provides a novel explanation for the results of dictator game experiments, in which participants often fairly split a resource rather than keeping it all for themselves.",Cooperation | Group selection | Inequality | Prosocial | Sharing,12.0,0.0,,,NSF,DGE1148897,National Science Foundation,Social and Cultural dynamics,

Individual learning, unbiased and biased social learning, mixed learning, and learning schedules are considered. A rapidly changing environment or frequent migration in a spatially heterogeneous environment favors individual learning over unbiased social learning. However, results are not so straightforward in the context of learning schedules or when biases in social learning are introduced. The three major methods of modeling temporal environmental change-coevolutionary, two-timescale, and information decay-are compared and shown to sometimes yield contradictory results. The so-called Rogers' paradox is inherent in the two-timescale method as originally applied to the evolution of pure strategies, but is often eliminated when the other methods are used. Moreover, Rogers' paradox is not observed for the mixed learning strategies and learning schedules that we review.

This extends to information foraging, where a knowledge-seeker shifts between reading in depth and studying new domains. To study this decision-making process, we examine the reading choices made by one of the most celebrated scientists of the modern era: Charles Darwin. From the full-text of books listed in his chronologically-organized reading journals, we generate topic models to quantify his local (text-to-text) and global (text-to-past) reading decisions using Kullback-Liebler Divergence, a cognitively-validated, information-theoretic measure of relative surprise. Rather than a pattern of surprise-minimization, corresponding to a pure exploitation strategy, Darwin's behavior shifts from early exploitation to later exploration, seeking unusually high levels of cognitive surprise relative to previous eras. These shifts, detected by an unsupervised Bayesian model, correlate with major intellectual epochs of his career as identified both by qualitative scholarship and Darwin's own self-commentary. Our methods allow us to compare his consumption of texts with their publication order. We find Darwin's consumption more exploratory than the culture's production, suggesting that underneath gradual societal changes are the explorations of individual synthesis and discovery. Our quantitative methods advance the study of cognitive search through a framework for testing interactions between individual and collective behavior and between short- and long-term consumption choices. This novel application of topic modeling to characterize individual reading complements widespread studies of collective scientific behavior.",Cognitive search | Exploration-exploitation | History of science | Information foraging | Scientific discovery | Topic modeling,37.0,0.0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,,Social and Cultural dynamics,

However, the definition of the patches being searched in mental space is not well specified. Do we search by activating explicit predefined categories (e.g., pets) and recall items from within that category (categorical search), or do we activate and recall a connected sequence of individual items without using categorical information, with each item recalled leading to the retrieval of an associated item in a stream (associative search), or both? Using semantic representations in a search of associative memory framework and data from the animal fluency task, we tested competing hypotheses based on associative and categorical search models. Associative, but not categorical, patch transitions took longer to make than position-matched productions, suggesting that categorical transitions were not true transitions. There was also clear evidence of associative search even within categorical patch boundaries. Furthermore, most individuals' behavior was best explained by an associative search model without the addition of categorical information. Thus, our results support a search process that does not use categorical information, but for which patch boundaries shift with each recall and local search is well described by a random walk in semantic space, with switches to new regions of the semantic space when the current region is depleted.",Natural categories | Optimal foraging | Semantic space | Verbal fluency,90.0,0.0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,,Social and Cultural dynamics,

Its silk production plays an important role in protection against external aggressions (predators, rains, etc.). It is also used for group dispersal through the formation of silkballs or as a thread during individual migration by walking. Until now, the role of silk in enhancing migration has been poorly studied. In this paper, the influence of the silken thread presence on T. urticae's locomotor activity is studied. One virgin female is placed at the centre of a cover glass partially covered by silk. Moving and resting time are studied on the silk or the clean part of the cover glass as a function of the starvation level of mites (fed vs. starved) and the age of the silk (30 vs. 60 vs. 90 vs. 120 vs. 150 min). Results show that a fed female spends more time on the silk-covered part than on the clean part as long as the silk is fresh (less than 120 min). Thus, the age-related changes in chemical and/or physical properties of the silk influence the spatial distribution of fed mites. Whatever the age of the silk, starved mites spend more time on the clean part of the set-up. Indeed, the silk freshly laid by conspecifics is attractive only for fed mites; starved mites probably prefer sites without silk (and conspecifics). This study shows that that the silk influences the spatial distribution of T. urticae according to its level of starvation and that silk is probably is an indicator of the presence of conspecifics. © 2011 Japan Ethological Society and Springer.",Locomotor activity | Silk | Stigmergy | Tetranychus urticae,15.0,0.0,,,INRS,2.4622.06,Institut national de la recherche scientifique,Social and Cultural dynamics,

The transmission of social information relies on social connections and therefore it is important to consider that individuals may vary in their access to, and use of, such information. Social network analysis allows for the consideration of individual variation in social connections, which until recently has been ignored in the study of social processes. Furthermore, few previous studies of social information use have considered the potential effects of traits such as dominance and personality, which have been found to influence group social structure. We used network-based diffusion analysis, which incorporates information on individual social associations, to examine whether wild flocks of black-capped chickadees, Poecile atricapillus, utilize social information when locating novel foraging patches. Additionally, we incorporated individual traits (age, sex, dominance and exploratory personality) while examining flocks from rural and urban environments, to assess the influence of individual and habitat level characteristics on the rate of information transmission. Social information transmission was found to occur in all flocks, as individual time of discovery of the novel foraging patches was explained by network connections as predicted. However, the only individual level variable found to influence social transmission was dominance rank: dominant individuals had higher rates of information transmission than subordinates. We also found that the rate of social information transmission was higher in rural than urban environments. Our results highlight the importance of considering social associations when examining social information use. Additionally, our results suggest that dominant individuals have greater access to social information than more subordinate individuals, which may demonstrate a previously undocumented additional benefit provided by social dominance.",group foraging | local enhancement | network centrality | network-based diffusion analysis | Paridae | social network analysis | urbanization,50.0,0.0,,,NSERC,31929,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,Social and Cultural dynamics,

Of fundamental interest are the causes of turbulent periods of conflict. We analyze conflict dynamics in an monkey society model system. We develop a technique, Inductive Game Theory, to extract directly from time-series data the decisionmaking strategies used by individuals and groups. This technique uses Monte Carlo simulation to test alternative causal models of conflict dynamics. We find individuals base their decision to fight on memory of social factors, not on short timescale ecological resource competition. Furthermore, the social assessments on which these decisions are based are triadic (self in relation to another pair of individuals), not pairwise. We show that this triadic decision making causes long conflict cascades and that there is a high population cost of the large fights associated with these cascades. These results suggest that individual agency has been over-emphasized in the social evolution of complex aggregates, and that pair-wise formalisms are inadequate.

The nodes in the network represent social actors, and the collection of ties represents a social relation. The assumptions posit that the network evolves as a stochastic process 'driven by the actors', i.e., the model lends itself especially for representing theories about how actors change their outgoing ties. The probabilities of tie changes are in part endogenously determined, i.e., as a function of the current network structure itself, and in part exogenously, as a function of characteristics of the nodes ('actor covariates') and of characteristics of pairs of nodes ('dyadic covariates'). In an extended form, stochastic actor-based models can be used to analyze longitudinal data on social networks jointly with changing attributes of the actors: dynamics of networks and behavior. This paper gives an introduction to stochastic actor-based models for dynamics of directed networks, using only a minimum of mathematics. The focus is on understanding the basic principles of the model, understanding the results, and on sensible rules for model selection.

Despite its recent debut, with conceptual foundations in 2008 and empirical foundations in 2010, the framework has received considerable attention and recognition in the last years. Methods: This paper provides a review of all empirical network studies published between 2010 and 2016 and discusses them according to three main themes: comorbidity, prediction, and clinical intervention. Results: Pertaining to comorbidity, the network approach provides a powerful new framework to explain why certain disorders may co-occur more often than others. For prediction, studies have consistently found that symptom networks of people with mental disorders show different characteristics than that of healthy individuals, and preliminary evidence suggests that networks of healthy people show early warning signals before shifting into disordered states. For intervention, centrality—a metric that measures how connected and clinically relevant a symptom is in a network—is the most commonly studied topic, and numerous studies have suggested that targeting the most central symptoms may offer novel therapeutic strategies. Conclusions: We sketch future directions for the network approach pertaining to both clinical and methodological research, and conclude that network analysis has yielded important insights and may provide an important inroad towards personalized medicine by investigating the network structures of individual patients.",Comorbidity | Early warning signals | Mental disorders | Network analysis | Treatment,550.0,1.0,publisherhybridgold,Hybrid Gold,H2020,647209,Horizon 2020 Framework Programme,Social and Cultural dynamics,

Using a pre-existing dataset from 255 groups playing a public goods game in thirteen economically diverse societies, we show that in nations with higher inequality, groups contribute less (Research question (RQ) 1). Further, we find that higher inequality is associated with lower optimism regarding others’ contributions at the outset of the game and increased sensitivity to others’ contributions, which accelerates the decay of cooperation (RQ2). These effects might be explained by national differences in social capital as expressed by trust and adherence to civic norms (RQ3).

To fill this gap, we model skill diversity within a simple model of collective learning and show that its effect on collective performance differs depending on the complexity of the task and the network density. In particular, we find that diversity consistently impairs performance in simple tasks. In contrast, in complex tasks, link density modifies the effect of diversity: while homogeneous populations outperform diverse ones in sparse networks, the opposite is true in dense networks, where diversity boosts collective performance.

Thus, the Darwinian dynamics of resistance are formidable barriers to all forms of systemic cancer treatment but rarely integrated into clinical trial design or included within precision oncology initiatives. Observations: We investigate cancer treatment as a game theoretic contest between the physician's therapy and the cancer cells' resistance strategies. This game has 2 critical asymmetries: (1) Only the physician can play rationally. Cancer cells, like all evolving organisms, can only adapt to current conditions; they can neither anticipate nor evolve adaptations for treatments that the physician has not yet applied. (2) It has a distinctive leader-follower (or ""Stackelberg"") dynamics; the ""leader"" oncologist plays first and the ""follower"" cancer cells then respond and adapt to therapy. Current treatment protocols for metastatic cancer typically exploit neither asymmetry. By repeatedly administering the same drug(s) until disease progression, the physician ""plays"" a fixed strategy even as the opposing cancer cells continuously evolve successful adaptive responses. Furthermore, by changing treatment only when the tumor progresses, the physician cedes leadership to the cancer cells and treatment failure becomes nearly inevitable. Without fundamental changes in strategy, standard-of-care cancer therapy typically results in ""Nash solutions"" in which no unilateral change in treatment can favorably alter the outcome. Conclusions and Relevance: Physicians can exploit the advantages inherent in the asymmetries of the cancer treatment game, and likely improve outcomes, by adopting more dynamic treatment protocols that integrate eco-evolutionary dynamics and modulate therapy accordingly. Implementing this approach will require new metrics of tumor response that incorporate both ecological (ie, size) and evolutionary (ie, molecular mechanisms of resistance and relative size of resistant population) changes.",,107.0,0.0,repositoryam,Green,NIH,R01CA170595,National Institutes of Health,Social and Cultural dynamics,

Instead, they result from a cumulative process in which innovations are gradually added to existing cultural traits across many generations. Recent work suggests that a population's ability to develop complex technologies is positively affected by its size and connectedness. Here, we present a simple computer-based experiment that compares the accumulation of innovations by fully and partially connected groups of the same size in a complex fitness landscape. We find that the propensity to learn from successful individuals drastically reduces cultural diversity within fully connected groups. In comparison, partially connected groups produce more diverse solutions, and this diversity allows them to develop complex solutions that are never produced in fully connected groups.

While cumulative cultural evolution depends on the interaction between social systems, cognition and the environment, there is increasing evidence that cumulative cultural evolution is facilitated by larger and more structured societies. However, such effects may be interlinked with patterns of social wiring, thus the relative importance of social network architecture as an additional factor shaping cumulative cultural evolution remains unclear. By simulating innovation and diffusion of cultural traits in populations with stereotyped social structures, we disentangle the relative contributions of network architecture from those of population size and connectivity. We demonstrate that while more structured networks, such as those found in multilevel societies, can promote the recombination of cultural traits into high-value products, they also hinder spread and make products more likely to go extinct. We find that transmission mechanisms are therefore critical in determining the outcomes of cumulative cultural evolution.

It then analyses the fundamental concepts used in the definition: action, agent, medium, trace and coordination. It clarifies how stigmergy enables complex, coordinated activity without any need for planning, control, communication, simultaneous presence, or even mutual awareness. The resulting self-organization is driven by a combination of positive and negative feedbacks, amplifying beneficial developments while suppressing errors.

The swarms move throughout the digital canvas in an attempt to satisfy their dynamic roles - attention to areas with more details - associated to them via their fitness function. Having associated the rendering process with the concepts of attention, the performance of the participating swarms creates a unique, non-identical sketch each time the 'artist' swarms embark on interpreting the input line drawings.

These features, however, have mainly not been considered in past studies where links are usually represented as binary states, i.e., either present or absent. Here, we study the scientific collaboration network and the world-wide air-transportation network, which are representative examples of social and large infrastructure systems, respectively. In both cases it is possible to assign to each edge of the graph a weight proportional to the intensity or capacity of the connections among the various elements of the network. We define appropriate metrics combining weighted and topological observables that enable us to characterize the complex statistical properties and heterogeneity of the actual strength of edges and vertices. This information allows us to investigate the correlations among weighted quantities and the underlying topological structure of the network.

We also find that the heterogeneity of the weight of individuals at the end of the game is higher when sensitivity and visibility are increased, but that the successful-defection-payoff has less impact on the weight of individuals and on the relationship between the heterogeneity of the weight of individuals and the density of cooperators.

Overall patterns of dominance relations, including some aspects of non-interactions, were strikingly similar across disparate group types. For example, nearly all groups exhibited high frequencies of transitive triads, whereas cycles were very rare. Moreover, pass-along triads were rare, and double-dominant triads were common in most groups. These patterns did not vary in any systematic way across taxa, study settings (captive or wild) or group size. Two factors significantly affected network motif structure: the proportion of dyads thatwere observed to interact and the interaction rates of the top-ranked individuals. Thus, study design (i.e. how many interactions were observed) and the behaviour of key individuals in the group could explain much of the variations we see in social hierarchies across animals.

Silk allows the spider to change its physical environment, which in turn leads to behavioural changes and impacts in the new environment. The feedback between silk and the animal producer can explain the architecture of spider webs and their adaptation to the environment, by referring only to stereotypic stimulus-response reactions without necessarily resorting to a representation by the animal of the structure it builds. Silk can act as a means of protection against environmental stress, a snare for prey, a means of locomotion, and also as support for chemical signals or to act as a vector of vibratory signals. These last two functions have undoubtedly played a key role in spider socialization and explains the phenomena of group cohesion, collective decision making, and the coordination of activities, without resorting to mental representations for the overall situation.

We conducted a detailed investigation of the unfolding of human entrainment - as expressed by the content and patterns of hundreds of thousands of messages on Twitter - during the 2012 US presidential debates. By time-locking these data sources, we quantify the impact of the unfolding debate on human attention at three time scales. We show that collective social behavior covaries second-by-second to the interactional dynamics of the debates: A candidate speaking induces rapid increases in mentions of his name on social media and decreases in mentions of the other candidate. Moreover, interruptions by an interlocutor increase the attention received. We also highlight a distinct time scale for the impact of salient content during the debates: Across well-known remarks in each debate, mentions in social media start within 5-10 seconds after it occurs; peak at approximately one minute; and slowly decay in a consistent fashion across well-known events during the debates. Finally, we show that public attention after an initial burst slowly decays through the course of the debates. Thus we demonstrate that large-scale human entrainment may hold across a number of distinct scales, in an exquisitely time-locked fashion.

However, it remains unclear how exactly human social transmission supports the accumulation of advantageous traits, and why we see little evidence of this in the natural behavior of other species.

These findings must be reconciled with the fact that human genome evolution cannot have been influenced by such a recent and culturally variable activity as reading. Capitalizing on recent functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments, we provide strong corroborating evidence for the hypothesis that reading acquisition partially recycles a cortical territory evolved for object and face recognition, the prior properties of which influenced the form of writing systems. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",,972.0,0.0,,,,undefined,,Cognitive Neuroscience,

Here we report the existence of these traces in the human brain. We presented to Finnish subjects the Finnish phoneme prototype /e/ as the frequent stimulus, and other Finnish phoneme prototypes or a non-prototype (the Estonian prototype /o/) as the infrequent stimulus. We found that the brain's automatic change-detection response, reflected electrically as the mismatch negativity (MMN), was enhanced when the infrequent, deviant stimulus was a prototype (the Finnish /o/) relative to when it was a non-prototype (the Estonian /o/). These phonemic traces, revealed by MMN, are language-specific, as /o/ caused enhancement of MMN in Estonians. Whole-head magnetic recordings located the source of this native- language, phoneme-related response enhancement, and thus the language- specific memory traces, in the auditory cortex of the left hemisphere.",,986.0,0.0,,,,undefined,,Cognitive Neuroscience,

Then we point to work showing that experimental psychologists have much to contribute to research on action generation. We focus on studies showing that actions are generated in a way that, at least by default, minimize changes between successive actions. The method is computationally as well as physically economical but also requires consideration of costs, including costs of different kinds. How such costs are compared is discussed in the next section. The final section offers comments about the future of psychologically focused action research. Two additional themes of the review concern methods for studying action generation. First, much can be learned through naturalistic observation. Second, subsequent experiments, designed to check naturalistic observations, can use very simple equipment and procedures.

In this paper, I will review such questions in the light of current research on sensory cue integration, where crossmodal correspondences can be conceptualized in terms of natural mappings across different sensory cues that are present in the environment and learnt by the sensory systems.

This more recent work demonstrates that mouse tracking is a widely applicable measure across the field, capable of exposing the microstructure of real-time decisions, including their component processes and millisecond-resolution time course, in ways that inform theory. In this article, recent advances in the mouse-tracking approach are described, and comparisons with the gold standard measure of reaction time and other temporally sensitive methodologies are provided.

Here we challenge this conclusion by showing that in the absence of contextual subormation, intentions can be suberred from body movement. Based on recent empirical findings, we shall contend that: (1) intentions translate into differential kinematic patterns; (2) observers are especially attuned to kinematic subormation and can use early differences in visual kinematics to anticipate the intention of an agent in performing a given action; (3) during interacting activities, predictions about the future course of others' actions tune online action planning; (4) motor activation during action observation subtends a complementary understanding of what the other is doing. These findings demonstrate that intention understanding is deeply rooted in social interaction: by simply observing others' movements, we might know what they have in mind to do and how we should act in response. © 2012 Becchio, Manera, Sartori, Cavallo and Castiello.",Complementary actions | Intention understanding | Kinematics | Mirror system | Reach-to-grasp | Social intention,137.0,1.0,publisherfullgold,Gold,,undefined,,Perception & Action,

Examples include improvisational theater and music, and day-to-day activities such as conversations. In joint improvisation, novel action is created, emerging from the interaction between people. Although central to creative processes and social interaction, joint improvisation remains largely unexplored due to the lack of experimental paradigms. Here we introduce a paradigm based on a theater practice called the mirror game. We measured the hand motions of two people mirroring each other at high temporal and spatial resolution. We focused on expert actors and musicians skilled in joint improvisation. We found that players can jointly create novel complex motion without a designated leader, synchronized to less than 40 ms. In contrast, we found that designating one player as leader deteriorated performance: The follower showed 2-3 Hz oscillation around the leader's smooth trajectory, decreasing synchrony and reducing the range of velocities reached. A mathematical model suggests a mechanism for these observations based on mutual agreement on future motion in mirrored reactive-predictive controllers.

We employ a longitudinal corpus of 32 preschoolers with ASD and 35 linguistically matched TD peers recorded over 6 visits (ranging between 2 and 5 years of age) to investigate the relative importance of child-based and environmental factors in language development for both populations. We also investigate the reciprocal interaction between children's response to parents’ input, and parents’ response to children's production. We report six major findings. (1) Children's production of word types, tokens, and MLU increased across visits, and were predicted by their Expressive Language (EL) (positively) and diagnosis (negatively) from Visit 1. (2) Parents’ production also increased across visits, and was predicted by their child's nonverbal cognition (positively) and diagnosis (negatively) from Visit 1. (3) At all visits and across groups, children and parents matched each other in lexical and syntactic production; (4) Parents who produced longer MLUs during a given visit had children who produced more word types and tokens, and had longer MLUs, at the subsequent visit. (5) When both child EL at Visit 1 and parent MLU were included in the model, both contributed significantly to future child language; however, EL accounted for a greater proportion of the variance.

The ability to achieve robust biological inference requires that practitioners know how and when to apply these tools. Here, we provide a general overview of current methods for the application of LMMs to biological data, and highlight the typical pitfalls that can be encountered in the statistical modelling process. We tackle several issues regarding methods of model selection, with particular reference to the use of information theory and multi-model inference in ecology. We offer practical solutions and direct the reader to key references that provide further technical detail for those seeking a deeper understanding. This overview should serve as a widely accessible code of best practice for applying LMMs to complex biological problems and model structures, and in doing so improve the robustness of conclusions drawn from studies investigating ecological and evolutionary questions.",AIC | Collinearity | GLMM | Mixed effects models | Model averaging | Model selection | Multi-model inference | Overdispersion | Random effects | Type I error,1220.0,1.0,repositoryam,Green,SEP,NE/H02249X/1,Secretaría de Educación Pública,Methods,

Inspired by the model of interpersonal synergy, we critically investigate the presence, temporal development, possible mechanisms and impact of shared interpersonal heart rate (HR) dynamics during individual and collective creative LEGO® construction tasks. In Study 1 we show how shared HR dynamics are driven by a plurality of sources, including task constraints and behavioral coordination. Generally, shared HR dynamics are more prevalent in individual trials (involving participants doing the same things) than in collective ones (involving participants taking turns and performing complementary actions). However, when contrasted against virtual pairs, collective trials display more stable shared HR dynamics suggesting that online social interaction plays an important role. Furthermore, in contrast to individual trials, shared HR dynamics are found to increase across collective trials. Study 2 investigates which aspects of social interaction might drive these effects. We show that shared HR dynamics are statistically predicted by interpersonal speech and building coordination. In Study 3, we explore the relation between HR dynamics, behavioral coordination, and self-reported measures of rapport and group competence. Although behavioral coordination predicts rapport and group competence, shared HR dynamics do not. Although shared physiological dynamics were reliably observed in our study, our results warrant not to consider HR dynamics a general driving mechanism of social coordination.

Previous research has primarily focused on interpersonal action coordination, which has been shown to be facilitated by mechanisms of prediction and mutual adaption. Recent research is beginning to show that people also coordinate their physiological rhythms (i.e., respiration, heart rhythms) when they engage in natural forms of social interaction, such as conversation, choir singing, and rituals. However, the mechanisms underlying interpersonal physiological synchronization remain obscure, and could provide insight into the dynamic mechanisms that underlie continuous and regulatory, rather than instrumental, joint actions. Using real-time biofeedback, we investigated whether people synchronize their respiration rhythms by forming a joint dynamical system through reciprocity of interaction, or by producing more predictable respiration rhythms. Our results show that people are more in-phase synchronized but less phase-locked when interacting bidirectionally versus unidirectionally (online), but there is no difference in synchronization during reciprocal interaction and when adapting unidirectionally (offline) to recordings of respiration signals that emerged during the reciprocal interaction. Moreover, the strength of synchronization is driven by the predictability of the respiration rhythms that emerge in the bidirectional interaction – specifically, the slowing of breathing rhythms and stability of breathing frequencies – rather than the online mutual adaptation itself. These results suggest that coordination is facilitated by the emergence of predictable breathing patterns, rather than reciprocity itself.",Biofeedback | Interpersonal coordination | Phase-locking | Physiological synchronization | Predictability | Reciprocity,2.0,1.0,publisherhybridgold,Hybrid Gold,FP7,0602-03001B,Seventh Framework Programme,Methods,

We systematically reviewed and meta-analyzed the evidence for distinctive acoustic patterns in schizophrenia, as well as their relation to clinical features.

Summary effect sizes (Hedges'g and Pearson's r) estimates were calculated using multilevel Bayesian modeling. We identified weak atypicalities in pitch variability (g = −0.55) related to flat affect, and stronger atypicalities in proportion of spoken time, speech rate, and pauses (g's between −0.75 and −1.89) related to alogia and flat affect. However, the effects were mostly modest (with the important exception of pause duration) compared to perceptual and clinical judgments, and characterized by large heterogeneity between studies. Moderator analyses revealed that tasks with a more demanding cognitive and social component showed larger effects both in contrasting patients and controls and in assessing symptomatology.

A recent meta-analysis identified an acoustic profile associated with schizophrenia (reduced pitch variability and increased pauses), but also highlighted shortcomings in the field: small sample sizes, little attention to the heterogeneity of the disorder, and to generalizing findings to diverse samples and languages. Study Design: We provide a critical cumulative approach to vocal atypicalities in schizophrenia, where we conceptually and statistically build on previous studies. We aim at identifying a cross-linguistically reliable acoustic profile of schizophrenia and assessing sources of heterogeneity (symptomatology, pharmacotherapy, clinical and social characteristics). We relied on previous meta-analysis to build and analyze a large cross-linguistic dataset of audio recordings of 231 patients with schizophrenia and 238 matched controls (>4000 recordings in Danish, German, Mandarin and Japanese). We used multilevel Bayesian modeling, contrasting meta-analytically informed and skeptical inferences. Study Results: We found only a minimal generalizable acoustic profile of schizophrenia (reduced pitch variability), while duration atypicalities replicated only in some languages. We identified reliable associations between acoustic profile and individual differences in clinical ratings of negative symptoms, medication, age and gender. However, these associations vary across languages. Conclusions: The findings indicate that a strong cross-linguistically reliable acoustic profile of schizophrenia is unlikely. Rather, if we are to devise effective clinical applications able to target different ranges of patients, we need first to establish larger and more diverse cross-linguistic datasets, focus on individual differences, and build self-critical cumulative approaches.",digital phenotyping | negative symptoms | prosody | psychosis | speech signal | vocal analysis,5.0,1.0,publisherfree2read,Bronze,AU,832518,Aarhus Universitet,Methods,

We present a novel, systematic approach to conceptual model development through qualitative synthesis and graphical analysis of hypotheses already present in the scientific literature. Our approach has five stages: researchers explicitly define the scope of the question, conduct a systematic review, extract hypotheses from prior studies, assemble hypotheses into a single network model and analyse trends in the model through network analysis. The resulting network can be analysed to identify shifts in thinking over time, variation in the application of ideas over different axes of investigation (e.g. geography, taxonomy, ecosystem type) and the most important hypotheses based on the network structure. To illustrate the approach, we present examples from a case study that applied the method to synthesize decades of research on the effects of forest fragmentation on birds. This approach can be used to synthesize scientific thinking across any field of research, guide future research to fill knowledge gaps efficiently and help researchers systematically build conceptual models representing alternative hypotheses.",conceptual model | hypothesis development | network analysis | synthesis methods,0.0,1.0,publisherfree2read,Bronze,NSF,DEB‐1557086,National Science Foundation,Methods,

This data-based approach make these models especially congenial for the analysis of children's language, since children do not learn and use the same units as adults. In this paper I employ a usage-based model of language to argue for five fundamental facts about child language acquisition: (1) the primary psycholinguistic unit of child language acquisition is the utterance, which has as its foundation the expression and understanding of communicative intentions; (2) early in their language development children are attempting to reproduce not adult words but whole adult utterances; (3) children's earliest utterances are almost totally concrete in the sense that they are instantiations of item-based schemas or constructions; (4) abstractions result from children generalizing across the type variation they observe at particular “slots” in otherwise recurrent tokens of the same utterance; and (5) children create novel utterances for themselves via usage-based syntactic operations in which they begin with an utterance-level schema and then modify that schema for the exigencies of the particular communicative situation (usage event) at hand. © 2001, 2000 by Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co.

In this review, I begin by examining gesture when it stands on its own, substituting for speech and clearly serving a communicative function. When called upon to carry the full burden of communication, gesture assumes a language-like form, with structure at word and sentence levels. However, when produced along with speech, gesture assumes a different form - it becomes imagistic and analog. Despite its form, the gesture that accompanies speech also communicates. Trained coders can glean substantive information from gesture - information that is not always identical to that gleaned from speech. Gesture can thus serve as a research tool, shedding light on speakers' unspoken thoughts. The controversial question is whether gesture conveys information to listeners not trained to read them. Do spontaneous gestures communicate to ordinary listeners? Or might they be produced only for speakers themselves? I suggest these are not mutually exclusive functions - gesture serves as both a tool for communication for listeners, and a tool for thinking for speakers.",,469.0,0.0,,,NSF,BNS 8810769,National Science Foundation,Cognition and Communication,

We outline the dual role of language (i.e., reflecting things about producers and impacting audiences), review some useful text analysis methods, and discuss how these approaches can help unlock a range of interesting questions",Automated text analysis | Cultural success | Culture | Language | Natural language processing,33.0,0.0,,,,undefined,,Cognition and Communication,

Lower levels of the perceptual hierarchy seem likely to be similar in all cultures, however, so we compared context sensitivity in Japan with that in the UK using a rigorous psychophysical measure of the effects of centre-surround contrast on size discrimination. In both cultures context sensitivity was greater for females working in the social sciences than for males working in the mathematical sciences. More surprisingly, context sensitivity was also much greater in Japan than in the UK. These findings show that, even at low levels of the visual-processing hierarchy, context sensitivity varies across cultures, and they raise important issues for both vision scientists and cross-cultural psychologists. © 2008 a Pion publication.",,58.0,0.0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,,Introduction to cognitive science,

Certainty also is a human desire providing comfort and surety. How can these two notions coexist? Results The way we perceive is the way we see and understand. Perception, however, is not objective; the way we 'know' what the sensory input we receive means arises from matching it against stored images of prior experiences, or put differently, the way we perceive the world depends on successfully predicting our own sensory status. Only large mismatches create new awareness resulting in new learning. At large we are prisoners of our own making, and awareness of the boundaries of our understanding will help to expand our horizon.

Emotional contagion is well established in laboratory experiments, with people transferring positive and negative emotions to others. Data from a large real-world social network, collected over a 20-y period suggests that longer-lasting moods (e.g., depression, happiness) can be transferred through networks [Fowler JH, Christakis NA (2008) BMJ 337:a2338], although the results are controversial. In an experiment with people who use Facebook, we test whether emotional contagion occurs outside of in-person interaction between individuals by reducing the amount of emotional content in the News Feed. When positive expressions were reduced, people produced fewer positive posts and more negative posts; when negative expressions were reduced, the opposite pattern occurred. These results indicate that emotions expressed by others on Facebook influence our own emotions, constituting experimental evidence for massive-scale contagion via social networks. This work also suggests that, in contrast to prevailing assumptions, in-person interaction and nonverbal cues are not strictly necessary for emotional contagion, and that the observation of others' positive experiences constitutes a positive experience for people.",Big data | Computer-mediated communication | Social media,2074.0,1.0,repositoryvor,Green,NCI,R25CA113710,National Cancer Institute,Introduction to cognitive science,

Third, children shift from relying on environmental signals for engaging cognitive control to becoming more self-directed.

Yet small-scale manual replication methods alone are ill-suited to deal with this big data problem. Here, we conduct a discipline-wide replication census in science. Our sample (N = 14,126 papers) covers nearly all papers published in the six top-tier Psychology journals over the past 20 y. Using a validated machine learning model that estimates a paper’s likelihood of replication, we found evidence that both supports and refutes speculations drawn from a relatively small sample of manual replications. First, we find that a single overall replication rate of Psychology poorly captures the varying degree of replicability among subfields. Second, we find that replication rates are strongly correlated with research methods in all subfields. Experiments replicate at a significantly lower rate than do non-experimental studies. Third, we find that authors’ cumulative publication number and citation impact are positively related to the likelihood of replication, while other proxies of research quality and rigor, such as an author’s university prestige and a paper’s citations, are unrelated to replicability. Finally, contrary to the ideal that media attention should cover replicable research, we find that media attention is positively related to the likelihood of replication failure.

The validity of the move from qualitative to quantitative analysis depends on the verbal and statistical expressions of a hypothesis being closely aligned - that is, that the two must refer to roughly the same set of hypothetical observations. Here, I argue that many applications of statistical inference in psychology fail to meet this basic condition. Focusing on the most widely used class of model in psychology - the linear mixed model - I explore the consequences of failing to statistically operationalize verbal hypotheses in a way that respects researchers' actual generalization intentions. I demonstrate that although the random effect formalism is used pervasively in psychology to model intersubject variability, few researchers accord the same treatment to other variables they clearly intend to generalize over (e.g., stimuli, tasks, or research sites). The under-specification of random effects imposes far stronger constraints on the generalizability of results than most researchers appreciate. Ignoring these constraints can dramatically inflate false-positive rates, and often leads researchers to draw sweeping verbal generalizations that lack a meaningful connection to the statistical quantities they are putatively based on.

Drawing inspiration from fields such as machine learning and statistical genetics, we argue in favor of introducing common benchmarks as a means of overcoming the lack of reliable model evaluation criteria currently observed in psychology. We discuss a number of principles benchmarks should satisfy to achieve maximal utility, identify concrete steps the community could take to promote the development of such benchmarks, and address a number of potential pitfalls and concerns that may arise in the course of implementation.

(1) Intentionality in human beings (and animals) is a product of causal features of the brain. I assume this is an empirical fact about the actual causal relations between mental processes and brains. It says simply that certain brain processes are sufficient for intentionality. (2) Instantiating a computer program is never by itself a sufficient condition of intentionality. The main argument of this paper is directed at establishing this claim. The form of the argument is to show how a human agent could instantiate the program and still not have the relevant intentionality. These two propositions have the following consequences: (3) The explanation of how the brain produces intentionality cannot be that it does it by instantiating a computer program. This is a strict logical consequence of 1 and 2. (4) Any mechanism capable of producing intentionality must have causal powers equal to those of the brain. This is meant to be a trivial consequence of 1. (5) Any attempt literally to create intentionality artificially (strong AI) could not succeed just by designing programs but would have to duplicate the causal powers of the human brain. This follows from 2 and 4. “Could a machine think?” On the argument advanced here only a machine could think, and only very special kinds of machines, namely brains and machines with internal causal powers equivalent to those of brains. And that is why strong AI has little to tell us about thinking, since it is not about machines but about programs, and no program by itself is sufficient for thinking. © 1980, Cambridge University Press.

Two variants of psi are precognition (conscious cognitive awareness) and premonition (affective apprehension) of a future event that could not otherwise be anticipated through any known inferential process. Precognition and premonition are themselves special cases of a more general phenomenon: the anomalous retroactive influence of some future event on an individual's current responses, whether those responses are conscious or nonconscious, cognitive or affective. This article reports 9 experiments, involving more than 1,000 participants, that test for retroactive influence by "" time-reversing"" well-established psychological effects so that the individual's responses are obtained before the putatively causal stimulus events occur.

Open-ended, abstract questions about what is required for survival tend to elicit responses that appeal to the importance of psychological characteristics. This emphasis on psychological characteristics is largely preserved even when participants are exposed to a concrete case that yields conflicting intuitions over whether memory must be preserved in order for a person to persist.

This void in knowledge is mainly due to the danger and difficulty of submitting the largest land animal to behavioral experiments. In an attempt to change this situation, a classical 1930s cooperation paradigm commonly tested on monkeys and apes was modified by using a procedure originally designed for chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) to measure the reactions of Asian elephants (Elephas maximus). This paradigm explores the cognition underlying coordination toward a shared goal. What do animals know or learn about the benefits of cooperation? Can they learn critical elements of a partner's role in cooperation? Whereas observations in nature suggest such understanding in nonhuman primates, experimental results have been mixed, and little evidence exists with regards to nonprimates. Here, we show that elephants can learn to coordinate with a partner in a task requiring two individuals to simultaneously pull two ends of the same rope to obtain a reward. Not only did the elephants act together, they inhibited the pulling response for up to 45 s if the arrival of a partner was delayed. They also grasped that there was no point to pulling if the partner lacked access to the rope. Such results have been interpreted as demonstrating an understanding of cooperation.

The process leading to fission is viewed as an unequal flow of sentiments and information across the ties in a social network. This flow is unequal because it is uniquely constrained by the contextual range and sensitivity of each relationship in the network. The subsequent differential sharing of sentiments leads to the formation of subgroups with more internal stability than the group as a whole, and results in fission. The Ford-Fulkerson labeling algorithm allows an accurate prediction of membership in the subgroups and of the locus of the fission to be made from measurements of the potential for information flow across each edge in the network. Methods for measurement of potential information flow are discussed, and it is shown that all appropriate techniques will generate the same predictions.",,,,,,,,,Social and Cultural dynamics,

Here we dub this field 'social physics' and pay our respect to intellectual mavericks who nurtured it to maturity. We do so by reviewing the current state of the art. Starting with a set of topics that are at the heart of modern human societies, we review research dedicated to urban development and traffic, the functioning of financial markets, cooperation as the basis for our evolutionary success, the structure of social networks, and the integration of intelligent machines into these networks. We then shift our attention to a set of topics that explore potential threats to society. These include criminal behaviour, large-scale migrations, epidemics, environmental challenges, and climate change. We end the coverage of each topic with promising directions for future research. Based on this, we conclude that the future for social physics is bright. Physicists studying societal phenomena are no longer a curiosity, but rather a force to be reckoned with.

Cognitive search in real-world contexts is often performed jointly. Yet, the way social interaction impacts cognitive search mechanisms and outcomes is understudied. Over three agent-based simulations, we investigated how social interaction modulates performance in cognitive search, focusing on two fundamental parameters: agents’ cognitive diversity and properties of their interaction. In Experiment 1, agents took turns in naming animals following a strict turn-taking protocol. We observed that moderate levels of diversity were beneficial to performance and induced more exploratory search behavior, but performance dropped dramatically at the highest levels of diversity. In Experiment 2, these detrimental effects of high diversity were mitigated by allowing agents to follow other and more flexible interaction protocols, which induced different and more efficient search strategies. In Experiment 3, we observed that endowing agents with more flexible cognitive systems (working memory) also had a positive impact on their performance. With this work, we provide new insights into how cognitive diversity and social interaction shape performance in joint cognitive search, and we present an innovative, flexible, and controllable computational paradigm to study emergent and mechanistic aspects of joint cognitive search.",,,,,,,,,Social and Cultural dynamics,
,10.1101/162313,,,The Evolution of Fair Offers with Low Rejection Thresholds in the Ultimatum Game,,,Schrank J.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The ultimatum game (UG) is widely used in economic and anthropological research to investigate fairness by how one player proposes to divide a resource with a second player who can reject the offer. In these contexts, fairness is understood as offers that are more generous than predicted by the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium (SPNE). A surprising and robust result of UG experiments is that proposers offer much more than the SPNE. These results have spawned many models aimed at explaining why players do not conform to the SPNE by showing how Nash equilibrium strategies can evolve far from the SPNE. However, empirical data from UG experiments indicate that players do not use Nash equilibrium strategies, but rather make generous offers while rejecting only very low offers. To better understand why people behave this way, we developed an agent-based model to investigate how generous strategies could evolve in the UG. Using agents with generic biological properties, we found that fair offers can readily evolve in structured populations even while rejection thresholds remain relatively low. We explain the evolution of fairness as a problem of the efficient conversion of resources into the production of offspring at the level of the group. Significance Statement Human generosity is widespread and far exceeds that of other social animals. Generosity is often studied experimentally with the ultimatum game, in which a proposer offers a split and a responder can either accept it or cancel the whole deal. A surprising result of ultimatum game experiments is that players are much more generous than predicted while only rejecting very low offers. This has presented a theoretical puzzle, since mathematical models have generally relied on high rejection levels—just below offer levels—to maintain generosity. Using evolutionary simulations, we explain both generous offers and the rejection of only low offers as a solution to the problem of how groups can efficiently convert resources into the production of offspring.",,,,,,,,,Social and Cultural dynamics,

It is argued that the degree of overlap of two individuals' friendship networks varies directly with the strength of their tie to one another. The impact of this principle on diffusion of influence and information, mobility opportunity, and community organization is explored. Stress is laid on the cohesive power of weak ties.

This study compared lateralised and non-lateralised moving visual stimuli to investigate whether the spatial characteristics or general alerting properties of moving visual stimuli are responsible for reducing neglect. Post-stroke left neglect patients as well as healthy and patient control subjects were tested on a computerised line bisection task under six visual stimulus conditions. The key finding was that, relative to the no stimulus condition, leftward moving and left-sided moving visual stimuli shifted neglect patients’ bisection errors leftward while the non-lateralised random moving visual stimuli did not reduce neglect patients’ rightward bisection errors. The results provide evidence that spatial characteristics rather than general alerting properties of moving visual stimuli reduce rightward bisection errors in ULN. Moreover, the pattern of findings strongly supports the notion that moving visual stimuli reduce neglect by capturing attention and drawing it to a spatial location rather than by activating the attentional system via superior collicular neurons.",,,,,,,,,Cognitive Neuroscience,

Due to its impact on many higher-order cognitive functions, investigating whether training can modify WM performance has recently been of great interest. We examined the relationship between behavioral performance and neural activity following five weeks of intensive WM training in 23 healthy older adults (M = 63.7 years). 12 participants received adaptive training (i.e. individually adjusted task difficulty to bring individuals to their performance maximum), whereas the others served as active controls (i.e. fixed low-level practice). Brain activity was measured before and after training, using fMRI, while subjects performed a WM task under two difficulty conditions. Although there were no training-related changes in WM during scanning, neocortical brain activity decreased post training and these decreases were larger in the adaptive training group than in the controls under high WM load. This pattern suggests intervention-related increases in neural efficiency. Further, there were disproportionate gains in the adaptive training group in trained as well as in non-trained (i.e. attention, episodic memory) tasks assessed outside the scanner, indicating the efficacy of the training regimen. Critically, the degree of training-related changes in brain activity (i.e. neocortical decreases and subcortical increases) was related to the maximum gain score achieved during the intervention period. This relationship suggests that the decreased activity, but also specific activity increases, observed were functionally relevant.",,,,,,,,,Cognitive Neuroscience,

Sensation, Perception, and Sensory Modality Sensations (also known as qualia) are primitive mental states or experiences induced by sensory stimulation. Perceptions are complex, organized, and meaningful experiences of objects or events. Qualia can be divided into seven distinct sensory modalities: audition, gustation, nociception, olfaction, somatosensation, the vestibular sense, and vision. The modalities differ in terms of the physical stimuli that excite them, the neural structures involved in transduction and sensory analysis, and the functions they serve. In humans, a much greater area of cortex is devoted to vision than to the other senses. The three key elements of perception are: Stimuli Neural responses Perceptions Stimuli generate neural responses which in turn lead to perceptual experiences. Psychophysics studies the relation between stimuli and perceptual experience, while neuroscience studies the relation between stimuli and neural responses. Psychophysical linking hypotheses propose specific links between perception and neural responses, as part of theories in computational neuroscience. Psychophysics Psychophysical methods to study perception were developed by Weber and Fechner in the 1800s, who established some fundamental laws governing the relation between sensory stimuli and sensation. Basic concepts in psychophysics include: Sensory thresholds Sensory magnitude Sensory adaptation Psychophysical linking hypotheses Cognitive Neuroscience Methods used to study sensation and perception include: Lesion experiments Clinical cases Single-unit recordings Neuroimaging Direct brain stimulation Basic concepts include: Neural impulses and transduction Hierarchical processing Specific nerve energy Selectivity Univariance Organization Plasticity Noise Computational Neuroscience The foundations of computational neuroscience were laid by three mathematicians: Alan Turing introduced the concept of universal computation Claude Shannon developed Information Theory David Marr introduced the three-level distinction between computational theory, representation, and hardware implementation Basic concepts include: Analog and symbolic representation Computation",,,,,,,,,Perception & Action,
,10.7551/mitpress/12441.001.0001,,,"Active Inference: The Free Energy Principle in Mind, Brain, and Behavior",,,Friston K.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Active Inference is a theory of how living artifacts sustain their existence by minimizing surprise—or a tractable proxy to surprise, variational free energy—via perception and action. In this chapter, we have sought to motivate this idea starting from a Bayesian treatment of perception as inference and extending this to the domain of action. Bayesian inference rests on a generative model of how sensory observations are generated, which encodes (probabilistically) the organism’s implicit knowledge of the world—formalized as prior beliefs and the expected outcomes under alternative states and policies. The specific take of Active Inference forces us to revisit the usual semantics of a prior in Bayesian inference. Expected states are preferred and include the organism’s conditions for survival (e.g., niche-specific goal states), whereas their opposite—surprising states—are dis-preferred. In this way, by fulfilling their expectations, Active Inference agents ensure their own survival. Given the important links between the notion of priors and the conditions that undergird an organism’s existence, we can also say that in Active Inference, the identity of an agent is isomorphic with its priors. This terminology will become more familiar later in the book. Note that in this view, surprise (or sometimes surprisal) is a formal construct of information theory and not necessarily equivalent to a (folk) psychological construct. Roughly, the more the organism’s state differs from the prior (which encodes the preferred states), the more it is surprising—hence Active Inference amounts to the idea that an organism (or its brain) has to actively minimize its surprise to stay alive. Under certain conditions, surprise minimization can be construed as the reduction of the discrepancy between the model and the world. More generally, the quantity that is actually minimized in Active Inference is variational free energy. Variational free energy is an (upper-bound) approximation to surprise and can be minimized efficiently using chemical or neuronal message passing and information that is available to the organism’s generative model. Importantly, both perception and action minimize variational free energy in complementary ways: by refining their (posterior belief) estimate and by performing actions that selectively sample what is expected. Furthermore, Active Inference also minimizes expected free energy by following policies associated with minimal ambiguity and risk. Expected free energy then extends Active Inference to prospective and counterfactual forms of inference. This completes our journey along the low road to Active Inference. In Chapter 3, we will travel the high road, which reaches the same conclusion on the basis of first principles and self-organization.",,,,,,,,,Perception & Action,
,10.31234/osf.io/e437b,,,Putting psychology to the test: Rethinking model evaluation through benchmarking and prediction,,,Rocca R.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Consensus on standards for evaluating models and theories is an integral part of every science. Nonetheless, in psychology, relatively little focus has been placed on defining reliable communal metrics to assess model performance. Evaluation practices are often idiosyncratic, and are affected by a number of shortcomings (e.g., failure to assess models' ability to generalize to unseen data) that make it difficult to discriminate between good and bad models. Drawing inspiration from fields like machine learning and statistical genetics, we argue in favor of introducing common benchmarks as a means of overcoming the lack of reliable model evaluation criteria currently observed in psychology. We discuss a number of principles benchmarks should satisfy to achieve maximal utility; identify concrete steps the community could take to promote the development of such benchmarks; and address a number of potential pitfalls and concerns that may arise in the course of implementation. We argue that reaching consensus on common evaluation benchmarks will foster cumulative progress in psychology, and encourage researchers to place heavier emphasis on the practical utility of scientific models.",,,,,,,,,Methods,

The use of these techniques remains nascent in psychiatry, and relatively little research has focused on the extent to which models derived in one sample make accurate predictions in unseen samples. Statistical research indicates that model performance in unseen samples is generally lower than performance in the derivation sample. Methods We investigate the generalizability of machine learned models using data from five multi-site randomized controlled trials of antipsychotic efficacy (total N = 1511). We include 125 predictor variables collected at baseline in all five trials, including demographics, psychological/behavioral scales (AIMS, BARS, CGI, PANSS, and SARS), vital signs, complete blood count, blood chemistry, and urinalysis. Using elastic net regression, we predicted 4-week treatment outcomes according to a binary cut-point of 25% reduction in PANSS scores. This study compared model performance for a range of internal and external validation methodologies. Results First, we trained a separate model on each of the five trials with no internal or external validation and obtained single-trial balanced accuracies from 74.6% to 100%. When each trial was split into a 50% training set and 50% holdout set, the balanced accuracies on the holdout test set were between 48% and 60.6%. When models were trained on each trial using 10-fold cross validation, balanced accuracies ranged from 50% to 73.7%. When each model was trained on a single trial and then sequentially tested on each of the four other trials, the mean balanced accuracy for each trial ranged from 50.5% to 54.2%. Finally, when the model was trained on four trials combined and tested on the one trial left out (leave-one-trial-out validation), balanced accuracies ranged from 48.9% to 58.7%. Discussion The performance of models predicting antipsychotic treatment response is highly affected by the validation routine chosen. Performance estimated using one trial—even using internal cross-validation—is drastically higher than the performance obtained when the same model is tested on independent data from other clinical trials with similar protocols. These findings present considerable cause for concern regarding the interpretation of predictive analyses based on a single, multi-site trial.",,,,,,,,,Methods,

Many have responded by pointing out conceptual or methodological discrepancies between the original and replication studies as potential explanations for divergent results, as well as emphasizing the importance of contextual moderators. To illustrate the importance of accounting for discrepancies between original and replication studies, as well as moderators, we turn to a recent example of a failed replication effort. Previous research has shown that individual differences in need for cognition interact with a message’s argument quality to affect evaluation (Cacioppo, Petty, & Morris, 1983). However, a recent attempt failed to replicate this outcome (Ebersole et al., in press). We propose that the latter study’s null result was due to conducting a non-optimal replication attempt. We thus conducted a new study that manipulated the key features that we propose created non-optimal conditions in the replication effort. The current results replicated the original need for cognition × argument quality interaction but only under the “optimal” conditions (closer to the original study’s method and accounting for subsequently identified moderators). Under the non-optimal conditions, mirroring those used by Ebersole et al., results replicated the failure to replicate the target interaction. These findings emphasize the importance of informed replication, an approach to replication that pays close attention to ongoing developments identified in an effect’s broader literature.",,,,,,,,,Applied Cognitive Science,

,,,,The social and emotional brain,,,Ward J.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Although there are many different theories of emotion (some in vogue, some rejected), there are a core set of ideas concerning emotions that have stood the test of time. This includes the idea that emotions have an evolved adaptive value, and this is largely conserved across species. It also includes the notion that emotions are multi-faceted: they contain both conscious (at least in humans) and unconscious processes; they involve the interplay of brain and body via the autonomic system (although emotions cannot be reduced to bodily sensations) and that (at least in humans) some emotions are constructed from both affective mechanisms and cognitive ones (e.g. appraisal). A good example of the latter is the so-called moral emotions (e.g. guilt, pride). Contemporary theories emphasize categorical distinctions between emotions (such as anger, fear sadness) but differ with regards to whether these categories represent natural kinds (i.e. innately specified categorical differences, as in the basic emotion approach) or are themselves constructed from different combinations of building blocks of other kinds of core processes (e.g. reward/punishment, pleasure, arousal, appraisals).",,,,,,,,,Introduction to cognitive science,Students guide to neuroscience
,,,,The social and emotional brain,,,Ward J.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This section has outlined a set of regions that are critically involved in the processing of emotions. In social animals, such as humans, these emotional brain regions play a key role in evaluating and judging social stimuli. For instance, the amygdala is not only implicated in evaluating whether a tone will lead to a shock, but also in evaluating whether another person is afraid; the anterior cingulate responds not only to physical pain but also responds to social pain relating to separation and social exclusion; and the nucleus accumbens responds not only to basic rewards (food, sex) but also responds when we opt to cooperate with another person. The different regions of the emotional brain serve different functions, and this is at odds with earlier theories of emotion (e.g. the Papez circuit and Maclean’s “limbic brain”). However, there is not a simple one-to-one mapping between brain structure and emotional category (e.g. amygdala = fear, insula = disgust) as predicted by a strong version of the “basic emotion” approach. Of course, “basic emotions” could still be said to exist at the level of brain circuits connecting specialized sub-regions and the best documented examples in the literature are fear and disgust. Other contemporary theories postulate the notion of “core affect” which consists of perceived internal body states and organized around the dimensions of intensity and pleasantness (Feldman Barrett, 2006). While there are brain regions that appear to have these characteristics (e.g. the amygdala shows some evidence of tracking intensity) on closer inspection their functioning is far more complex (e.g. the evidence that the amygdala has somewhat different roles in fear versus reward conditioning). Finally, almost all contemporary theories of emotion allow for a role of ""cognition"" by which is meant thoughts and beliefs, appraisals, control mechanisms and the like. This is supported by the neuroscience evidence but stands in contrast to some earlier views that emotion was somehow distinct from cognition (for a summary see Phelps, 2006). An emotion is best regarded as a complex affective state in which cognitions are intrinsically embedded rather than standing apart.",,,,,,,,,Introduction to cognitive science,Students guide to neuroscience
,,,,Perception,,,Anderson J. R.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This chapter discusses how neurons process sensory information and deliver it to higher centers in the brain, and how the information is then processed and combined with contextual information to perceive and recognize objects. Figure 2.31 depicts the overall flow of information processing in the case of vision perception. Perception begins with light energy from the external environment. Receptors, such as those in the retina, transform this energy into neural information. Early sensory processing makes initial sense of the information by extracting features to yield what Marr (1982) called a primal sketch. These features are combined with depth information to get a representation of the location of surfaces in space; this is Marr’s 2½-D sketch. The gestalt principles of organization are applied to segment the elements in the 2½-D sketch into objects; this is Marr’s 3-D model. Finally, information about the features of these objects and general context information are combined to recognize the objects. The output of this last level is a representation of the objects and their locations in the environment, and this is what we are consciously aware of in perception. This information is then input to higher-level cognitive processes. Figure 2.31 illustrates an important point: A great deal of information processing must take place before we are consciously aware of the objects we are perceiving.",,,,,,,,,Introduction to cognitive science,Cognitive psychology and its implications
,,,,Attention and Performance,,,Anderson J. R.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"There has been a gradual shift in the way cognitive psychology perceives the issue of attention. For a long time, the implicit assumption was captured by this famous quote from William James (1890, pp. 403–404) over a century ago: Everyone knows what attention is. It is the taking possession by the mind, in a clear and vivid form, of one out of what seem several simultaneously possible objects or trains of thought. Focalization, concentration of consciousness are of its essence. It implies withdrawal from some things in order to deal effectively with others. Two features of this quote reflect conceptions once held about attention. The first is that attention is strongly related to consciousness — we cannot attend to something unless we are conscious of it. The second is that attention, like consciousness, is a unitary system. More and more, cognitive psychology is beginning to recognize that attention also operates at an unconscious level. For instance, people often are not conscious of where they have moved their eyes. Along with this recognition has come the realization that attention is multifaceted (e.g., Chun, Golumb, & Turk-Browne, 2011). We have seen that it makes sense to separate auditory attention from visual attention and to distinguish between attention in perceptual processing, attention in executive control, and attention in response generation. The brain consists of a number of parallel processing systems for the various perceptual systems, for motor systems, and for central cognition. Each of these parallel systems seems to suffer bottlenecks — points at which it must focus its processing on a single thing. Attention is best conceived as the processes by which each of these systems is allocated to potentially competing information-processing demands. The amount of interference that occurs among tasks making demands on the same system is a function of the overlap in timing among those demands.",,,,,,,,,Introduction to cognitive science,Cognitive psychology and its implications
,,,,Mental Imagery,,,Anderson J. R.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This chapter has reviewed some of the evidence that the brain regions involved in visual perception are also involved in visual imagery. Such research has presumably put to rest the question raised at the beginning of the chapter about whether visual imagery really has a perceptual character. However, although it seems clear that perceptual processes are involved in visual imagery to some degree, the degree to which the mechanisms of visual imagery are the same as the mechanisms of visual perception remains an open question. Evidence for a substantial overlap comes from neuropsychological patient studies (see Bartolomeo, 2002, for a review). Many patients who have cortical damage leading to blindness have corresponding deficits in visual imagery. As Behrmann (2000) notes, the correspondences between perception and imagery can be quite striking. For instance, there are patients who are not able to perceive or image faces and colors, but are otherwise unimpaired in either perception or imagery. Nonetheless, there also exist cases of patients who suffer perceptual problems but have intact visual imagery, and vice versa. Behrmann argues that visual perception and visual imagery are best understood as two processes that overlap but are not identical, as illustrated in Figure 4.22. Perceiving a kangaroo requires low-level visual information processing that is not required for visual imagery. Similarly, forming a mental image of a kangaroo requires high-level generation processes that are not required by perception. Behrmann suggests that patients who suffer only perceptual losses have damage to the low-level part of this system, and patients who suffer only imagery losses have damage to the high-level part of this system.",,,,,,,,,Introduction to cognitive science,Cognitive psychology and its implications
,,,,Representation of Knowledge,,,Anderson J. R.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Estimates of the storage capacity (e.g., Moll & Miikkulainen, 1997; Treves & Rolls, 1994) of the brain differ substantially, but they are all many orders of magnitude less than what would be required to store a faithful video recording of our whole life. This chapter has reviewed studies of what we retain and what we forget — for instance, for Figure 5.5, what subject was being taught, but not what the teacher was wearing; or for Figure 5.14, that the room was an office, but not what was in the office. The chapter also reviewed three perspectives on the basis for this selective memory. 1. The multimodal hypothesis (Figure 5.12 left), which proposes that we select important aspects of our experience to remember and often convert meanings from one modality to another. For instance, we may describe a room (visual) as an “office” (verbal). 2. The amodal hypothesis (Figure 5.12 right), which proposes that we convert our experience into some abstract representation that just encodes what is important. For instance, the chapter discussed how propositions captured the connections among the concepts in our understanding of a sentence. 3. Theories proposing that we remember our experiences in terms of the categories that they seem to exemplify. We discussed a varied set of such category representations: semantic networks, schemas, scripts, exemplar, prototype, and rule based. These hypotheses are not mutually exclusive, and cognitive scientists are actively engaged in trying to understand when a particular kind of knowledge representation is used to encode experience.",,,,,,,,,Introduction to cognitive science,Cognitive psychology and its implications
,,,,Human Memory: Encoding and Storage,,,Anderson J. R.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This chapter has focused on the processes involved in getting information into memory. We saw that a great deal of information gets registered in sensory memory, but relatively little can be maintained in short-term or working memory and even less survives for long periods of time. However, an analysis of what actually gets stored in long-term memory really needs to consider how that information is retained and retrieved — which is the topic of the next chapter. Many of the issues considered in this chapter are complicated by retrieval issues. This is certainly true for the effects of elaborative processing that we have just discussed. There are important interactions between how a memory is processed at study and how it is processed at test. Even in this chapter, we were not able to discuss the effects of such factors as practice without discussing the activation-based retrieval processes that are facilitated by these factors. Chapter 7 will also have more to say about the activation of memories.",,,,,,,,,Introduction to cognitive science,Cognitive psychology and its implications
,,,,Human Memory: Retention and Retrieval,,,Anderson J. R.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Figure 7.17 shows the different types and subtypes of memory proposed by Squire (1987). The major distinction in his classification is between explicit memory and implicit memory, which he calls declarative memory and nondeclarative memory. It appears that the hippocampus is particularly important for the establishment of declarative memories. Within the declarative memory system, there is a distinction between episodic and semantic memory. Episodic memories include information about where and when they were acquired. For example, a memory of a particular newscast can be considered an episodic memory. This chapter and Chapter 6 have discussed these kinds of memories. Semantic memories, discussed in Chapter 5, reflect general knowledge of the world, such as what a dog is or what a restaurant is. Figure 7.17 makes it clear that there are many kinds of nondeclarative, or implicit, memories. We have just completed a discussion of procedural memories and the critical role of the basal ganglia and cerebellum in their formation. We also talked about priming and the fact that priming seems to entail changes to cortical regions directly responsible for processing the information involved. There are other kinds of learning that we have not discussed but that are particularly important in studies of animal learning. These include conditioning and the two types of memory labeled nonassociative in Figure 7.17, habituation and sensitization, all of which have been demonstrated in species ranging from sea slugs to humans. Evidence suggests that conditioning in mammals involves many different brain structures (Anderson, 2000), as do many other types of learning, with different brain structures supporting different kinds of learning.",,,,,,,,,Introduction to cognitive science,Cognitive psychology and its implications

In fact, in today’s world people routinely acquire whole new sets of skills over their lifetimes. For instance, I now use my phone for instant messaging, GPS navigation, and surfing the Web — functions that I could not have imagined when I was a young man, let alone associated with a phone. This chapter has emphasized the role of practice in acquiring such skills, and certainly it has taken me some considerable practice to master them. However, human flexibility depends on more than time on task — other creatures could never acquire such skills. Critical to human expertise are the higher-order problem-solving skills that we reviewed in Chapter 8. Also critical is our human ability to reason, make decisions, and communicate by language. These are the topics of the forthcoming chapters.",,,,,,,,,Introduction to cognitive science,Cognitive psychology and its implications
,,,,Decision Making,,,Anderson J. R.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Decision making deals with choosing actions that can have real consequences in the presence of real uncertainty. All mammals have the dopamine system that we just described, which gives them a basic ability to seek things that are rewarding and avoid things that are harmful. However, humans, by virtue of their greatly expanded prefrontal cortex, have a highly developed capacity to reflect on their circumstances and select actions other than what their more primitive systems might urge. Research suggests that the ventromedial portion of the human prefrontal cortex, which is proportionally much larger than the same region in the genetically similar apes, might play a particularly important role in such regulation. Humans attempt acts of self-regulation — for example, diet plans — that are far beyond the reach of any other species. However, we live in an uncertain world, as evidenced by all the contradictory claims made for various diet plans. Perhaps if we understood better how people respond to such uncertainty and to such contradictory information, we would also be in a better position to understand why there are so many failures of our good resolutions.",,,,,,,,,Introduction to cognitive science,Cognitive psychology and its implications
,,,,Individual differences in Cognition,,,Anderson J. R.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Two recurring themes throughout this book have been the diversity of the components of the mind and the specialization of different brain regions to perform different functions. The first chapter reviewed the evidence for different specializations in the nervous system. Subsequent chapters reviewed the evidence for different levels of processing as information entered the system and then discussed the different types of knowledge representation and the distinction between procedural and declarative knowledge. Then, we considered the distinct status of language. Many of the findings discussed in those chapters have been reinforced in this chapter on individual differences. Another recurring theme has been the importance of the rate of processing: Response time has been the most frequently used measure of cognitive functioning in this book. Often, error measures (the second most common dependent measure) were shown to be merely indications of slow processing. We have seen evidence in this chapter that individuals vary in their rate of processing, and we have stressed that this rate can be increased with practice. In addition to the quantitative component of speed, individual differences have a qualitative component: People can differ in where their strengths lie. They can also differ in their selection of strategies for solving problems. We saw evidence in Chapter 9 that one dimension of growing expertise is the development of more effective strategies. One might view the human mind as being analogous to a large corporation that consists of many interacting components. The differences among corporations are often due to the relative strengths of their components. With practice, different components tend to become more efficient at doing their tasks. Another way to achieve improvement is by strategic reorganizations of parts of the corporation. However, there is more to a successful company than just the sum of its parts: The parts have to interact smoothly to achieve the overall goals of the organization. Some researchers (e.g., Newell, 1990) have complained about the rather fragmented picture of the human mind that emerges from current research in cognitive psychology. One agenda for future research will be to understand how all the pieces fit together to make a human mind.",,,,,,,,,Introduction to cognitive science,Cognitive psychology and its implications

The chapter discusses “centering” (subtracting the mean) and “standardizing” (dividing by the standard deviation) as two common linear transformations.

Along the way, the chapter also introduces the very important concept of “effect size”, and standardized effect size measures such as Pearson’s correlation coefficient and Cohen’s d are discussed. After discussing effect size, the reader is introduced to standard errors and confidence intervals.

This discussion is used to argue for the importance of statistical power (the ability to detect an effect if the null hypothesis is actually false). Researchers in all disciplines, including linguistics, should strive to conduct “high-powered” studies—for example, by collecting as much data as possible. The chapter also discusses the important issue of “multiple testing”: when a researcher conducts lots of significance tests on the same dataset, the chance that any of these tests is significant increases drastically—even if nothing is going on in the dataset. This issue can be circumvented by “correcting” one’s alpha level (being more conservative in accepting significant results); however, the best recommendation is to perform as few significance tests if possible—especially if there are clear theoretical motivations for doing so.",,,,,,,,,Methods,Statistics for linguists: An Introduction using R

Because the dataset is hand-generated, the “ground truth” of the data can be compared to the model output. The reader is walked through interpreting the output of a mixed model. The second example introduces mixed logistic regression, a form of mixed model suitable for binary categorical data. In this case, a discourse analysis dataset of “ugly selfies” is analyzed. The chapter also discusses remaining topics in mixed models, such as convergence issues and shrinkage.",,,,,,,,,Methods,Statistics for linguists: An Introduction using R
,,,,Generalized Linear Models 1: Logistic Regression,,,Winter B.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"In a lot of linguistic applications, researchers are interested in modeling a categorical outcome variable (such as whether a speaker has used active voice or passive voice) as a function of various predictors. For this, generalized linear models (GLMs) can be used, which are an extension of linear models. With GLMs, one can relax assumptions imposed on the distribution of the response variable, which allows modeling categorical data. The reader is introduced to one specific form of GLM, logistic regression. This form of regression is suitable to modeling binary categorical data (active versus passive voice, correct versus incorrect, etc.). Along the way, the chapter introduces the Bernoulli distribution, log odds (logits), and the logistic function. Since many errors can happen with interpreting logit coefficients, the chapter walks the reader through several examples, including modeling the English dative alternation and a psycholinguistic experiment of gesture perception.",,,,,,,,,Methods,Statistics for linguists: An Introduction using R
,,,,Interactions and Nonlinear Effects,,,Winter B.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The term “interaction” describes situations in which one predictor’s influence on a linguistic variable is conditioned on another predictor. Informally, we can speak of interactions as cases where predictors are “more than the sum of their parts”. Mathematically, interactions are multiplicative rather than additive effects. Interactions are extremely common in linguistic data, and they are often theoretically very interesting. However, unfortunately, interactions make the interpretation of one’s models much more difficult, and many linguists commonly misinterpret their models in the presence of interactions. To combat this, the chapter walks the reader through numerous examples of interactions. Example analyses include datasets of a conceptual metaphor experiment, as well as a study on iconicity (how much a word sounds like what it means).",,,,,,,,,Methods,Statistics for linguists: An Introduction using R
,,,,Exploring Assumptions,,,Field A.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"‘You promised us swans,’ I hear you cry, ‘and all we got was normality this, homosomethingorother that, transform this, it’s all a waste of time that. Where were the bloody swans?!’ Well, the Queen owns them all so I wasn’t allowed to have them. Nevertheless, this chapter did negotiate Dante’s eighth circle of hell (Malebolge), where data of deliberate and knowing evil dwell. That is, data that don’t conform to all of those pesky assumptions that make statistical tests work properly. We began by seeing what assumptions need to be met for parametric tests to work, but we mainly focused on the assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variance. To look for normality we rediscovered the joys of frequency distributions, but also encountered some other graphs that tell us about deviations from normality (Q-Q plots). We saw how we can use skew and kurtosis values to assess normality and that there are statistical tests that we can use (the Shapiro–Wilk test). While negotiating these evildoers, we discovered what homogeneity of variance is, and how to test it with Levene’s test and Hartley’s Fmax. Finally, we discovered redemption for our data. We saw we can cure their sins, make them good, with transformations (and on the way we discovered some of the uses of the by() function and the transformation functions). Sadly, we also saw that some data are destined always to be evil. We also discovered that I had started to read. However, reading was not my true passion; it was music. One of my earliest memories is of listening to my dad’s rock and soul records (back in the days of vinyl) while waiting for my older brother to come home from school, so I must have been about 3 at the time. The first record I asked my parents to buy me was ‘Take on the World’ by Judas Priest, which I’d heard on Top of the Pops (a now defunct UK TV show) and liked. This record came out in 1978 when I was 5. Some people think that this sort of music corrupts young minds. Let’s see if it did …",,,,,,,,,Methods,Discovering Statistics Using R
,,,,Correlation,,,Field A.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This chapter has looked at ways to study relationships between variables. We began by looking at how we might measure relationships statistically by developing what we already know about variance (from Chapter 1) to look at variance shared between variables. This shared variance is known as covariance. We then discovered that when data are parametric we can measure the strength of a relationship using Pearson’s correlation coefficient, r. When data violate the assumptions of parametric tests we can use Spearman’s rs , or for small data sets Kendall’s τ may be more accurate. We also saw that correlations can be calculated between two variables when one of those variables is a dichotomy (i.e., composed of two categories); when the categories have no underlying continuum then we use the point-biserial correlation, rpb, but when the categories do have an underlying continuum we use the biserial correlation, rb . Finally, we looked at the difference between partial correlations, in which the relationship between two variables is measured controlling for the effect that one or more variables has on both of those variables, and semi-partial correlations, in which the relationship between two variables is measured controlling for the effect that one or more variables has on only one of those variables. We also discovered that I had a guitar and, like my favourite record of the time, I was ready to ‘Take on the World’. Well, Wales at any rate …",,,,,,,,,Methods,Discovering Statistics Using R
,,,,Neurons and Glia,,,Bear M.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Learning the structural characteristics of the neuron provides insight into how neurons and their different parts work because structure correlates with function. For example, the absence of ribosomes in the axon correctly predicts that proteins in the axon terminal are provided from the soma via axoplasmic transport. A large number of mitochondria in the axon terminal correctly predicts a high energy demand. The elaborate structure of the dendritic tree appears ideally suited for receiving incoming information, and indeed, this is where most of the synapses are formed with the axons of other neurons. From the time of Nissl, the rough ER has been recognized as an important feature of neurons. What does this tell us about neurons? Recall that rough ER is a site of the synthesis of proteins destined to be inserted into the membrane. We will next see how the various proteins in the neuronal membrane give rise to the unique capabilities of neurons to transmit, receive, and store information.",,,,,,,,,Cognitive Neuroscience,Neuroscience: Exploring the Brain
,,,,The Action Potential,,,Bear M.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Let’s return briefly to the example in Chapter 3 of stepping on a thumbtack. The breaking of the skin caused by the tack stretches the sensory nerve endings of the foot. Special ion channels that are sensitive to the stretching of the membrane open and allow positively charged sodium ions to enter the ends of the axons in the skin. This influx of positive charge depolarizes the membrane to threshold, and the action potential is generated. The positive charge that enters during the rising phase of the action potential spreads along the axon and depolarizes the membrane ahead to threshold. In this way, the action potential is continuously regenerated as it sweeps like a wave along the sensory axon. We now come to the step where this information is distributed to and integrated by other neurons in the central nervous system. This transfer of information from one neuron to another is called synaptic transmission, the subject of the next two chapters. It should come as no surprise that synaptic transmission, like the action potential, depends on specialized proteins in the neuronal membrane. Thus, a picture begins to emerge of the brain as a complicated mesh of interacting neuronal membranes. Consider that a typical neuron with all its neurites has a membrane surface area of about 250,000 μm². The surface area of the 85 billion neurons that make up the human brain comes to 21,250 m²—roughly the size of three soccer fields. This expanse of membrane, with its myriad specialized protein molecules, constitutes the fabric of our minds.",,,,,,,,,Cognitive Neuroscience,Neuroscience: Exploring the Brain
,,,,Synaptic Transmission,,,Bear M.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This chapter has covered the basic principles of chemical synaptic transmission. The action potential that arose in the sensory nerve when you stepped on that thumbtack in Chapter 3, and that swept along the axon in Chapter 4, has now reached the axon terminal in the spinal cord. The depolarization of the terminal triggered the presynaptic entry of Ca²⁺ through voltage-gated calcium channels, which then stimulated exocytosis of the contents of synaptic vesicles. Liberated neurotransmitter diffused across the synaptic cleft and attached to specific receptors in the postsynaptic membrane. The transmitter (probably glutamate) caused transmitter-gated channels to open, which allowed positive charge to enter the postsynaptic dendrite. Because the sensory nerve was firing action potentials at a high rate, and because many synapses were activated at the same time, the EPSPs summed to bring the spike-initiation zone of the postsynaptic neuron to threshold, and this cell then generated action potentials. If the postsynaptic cell is a motor neuron, this activity will cause the release of ACh at the neuromuscular junction and muscle contraction to jerk your foot away from the tack. If the postsynaptic cell is an interneuron that uses GABA as a neurotransmitter, the activity of the cell will result in inhibition of its synaptic targets. If this cell uses a modulatory transmitter such as NE, the activity could cause lasting changes in the excitability or metabolism of its synaptic targets. It is this rich diversity of chemical synaptic interactions that allows complex behaviors (such as shrieking with pain as you jerk up your foot) to emerge from simple stimuli (such as stepping on a thumbtack). Although we surveyed chemical synaptic transmission in this chapter, we did not cover the chemistry of synaptic transmission in any detail. In Chapter 6, we’ll take a closer look at the chemical “nuts and bolts” of different neurotransmitter systems. In Chapter 15, after we’ve examined the sensory and motor systems in Part II, we’ll explore the contributions of several different neurotransmitters to nervous system function and behavior. You’ll see that the chemistry of synaptic transmission warrants all this attention because defective neurotransmission is the basis for many neurological and psychiatric disorders. And virtually all psychoactive drugs, both therapeutic and illicit, exert their effects at chemical synapses. In addition to explaining aspects of neural information processing and the effects of drugs, chemical synaptic transmission is also the key to understanding the neural basis of learning and memory. Memories of past experiences are established by modification of the effectiveness of chemical synapses in the brain. This chapter suggests possible sites of modification, ranging from changes in presynaptic Ca²⁺ entry and neurotransmitter release to alterations in postsynaptic receptors or excitability. As we shall see in Chapter 25, all of these changes are likely to contribute to the storage of information by the nervous system.",,,,,,,,,Cognitive Neuroscience,Neuroscience: Exploring the Brain
,,,,The Structure of the Nervous System,,,Bear M.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Although we have covered a lot of new ground in this chapter, we have only scratched the surface of neuroanatomy. Clearly, the brain deserves its status as the most complex piece of matter in the universe. What we have presented here is a shell, or scaffold, of the nervous system and some of its contents. Understanding neuroanatomy is necessary for understanding how the brain works. This statement is just as true for an undergraduate first-time neuroscience student as it is for a neurologist or a neurosurgeon. In fact, neuroanatomy has taken on a new relevance with the advent of methods of imaging the living brain (Figure 7.30). An Illustrated Guide to Human Neuroanatomy appears as an appendix to this chapter. Use the guide as an atlas to locate various structures of interest. Labeling exercises are also provided to help you learn the names of the parts of the nervous system you will encounter in this book. In Part II, Sensory and Motor Systems, the anatomy presented in this chapter and its appendix will come alive, as we explore how the brain goes about the tasks of smelling, seeing, hearing, sensing touch, and moving.",,,,,,,,,Cognitive Neuroscience,Neuroscience: Exploring the Brain
,,,,Brain rhythms and Sleep,,,Bear M.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Rhythms are ubiquitous in the vertebrate central nervous system. They also span a broad range of frequencies, from more than 500 Hz in the cortical EEG to once per year (0.00000003 Hz) for many seasonal behaviors, such as the autumn mating of deer, the winter hibernation of chipmunks, and the instinct that drives migrating swallows to return to Capistrano, California every March 19. According to local legend, in 200 years, these swallows have missed the date only twice. In some cases, these rhythms are based on intrinsic brain mechanisms; in some, they result from environmental factors; and in others, such as the SCN clock, they represent an interaction of a neural process and zeitgebers. While the purpose of some rhythms is obvious, the functions of many neural rhythms are unknown. Indeed, some rhythms may have no function at all but arise as a secondary consequence of neural interconnections that are essential for other, nonrhythmic, purposes. Among the most conspicuous yet inexplicable of brain rhythms is sleep. Sleep provides a fascinating set of problems for neuroscience. Unlike most studies of single ion channels, single neurons, or the systems mediating perception and movement, sleep research begins with profound ignorance about a most basic question: Why? We still don’t know why we spend one-third of our lives sleeping, most of that time languid and vegetative and the rest of it paralyzed and hallucinating. Sleep and dreams may have no vital function, but they can be studied and enjoyed nevertheless. Ignoring the functional question will not be a satisfying approach for long, however. For most neuroscientists, asking “Why?” remains the deepest and most challenging problem of all.",,,,,,,,,Cognitive Neuroscience,Neuroscience: Exploring the Brain
,,,,The Central Visual System,,,Bear M.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"In this chapter, we have outlined the organization of the sensory pathway from the eye to the thalamus to the cortex. We saw that vision actually involves the perception of numerous different properties of objects—including color, form, and movement—and these properties are processed in parallel by different cells of the visual system. This processing of information evidently requires a strict segregation of inputs at the thalamus, some limited convergence of information in the striate cortex, and finally a massive divergence of information as it is passed on to higher cortical areas. The distributed nature of the cortical processing of visual information is underscored when you consider that the output of a million ganglion cells can recruit the activity of well over a billion cortical neurons throughout the occipital, parietal, and temporal lobes! Somehow, this widespread cortical activity is combined to form a single, seamless perception of the visual world. Heed the lessons learned from the visual system. As we shall see in later chapters, the basic principles of organization in this system—parallel processing, topographic mappings of sensory surfaces, synaptic relays in the dorsal thalamus, cortical modules, and multiple cortical representations—are also features of the sensory systems devoted to hearing and touch.",,,,,,,,,Cognitive Neuroscience,Neuroscience: Exploring the Brain
,,,,The auditory and vestibular systems,,,Bear M.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Hearing and balance begin with nearly identical sensory receptors, the hair cells, which are exquisitely sensitive to deflections of their stereocilia. These movement detectors are surrounded by three sets of inner ear structures that give them selectivity for three different kinds of mechanical energy: periodic waves of air pressure (sound), rotational forces (head turns), and linear forces (head tilt or acceleration). Except for the similarity in transduction, and the fact that the hair cells of both systems are located in the inner ear, the auditory and vestibular systems are quite different. The sound sensed by audition comes mainly from the external environment, while the vestibular system senses only the movements of itself. Auditory and vestibular pathways are entirely separate except perhaps at the highest levels of the cortex. Auditory information is often at the forefront of our consciousness, while vestibular sensation usually operates unnoticed to coordinate and calibrate our every movement. We have followed the auditory pathways from the ear to cerebral cortex and seen the ways in which information about sound is transformed. Variations in the density of air are converted to movements of the mechanical components of the middle and inner ear, which are transduced into neural responses. The structures of the ear and cochlea are highly specialized for the transduction of sound. However, this fact should not blind us to the considerable similarities between the organization of the auditory system and that of other sensory systems. Many analogies can be made between the auditory and visual systems. In the sensory receptors of both systems, a spatial code is established. In the visual system, the code in the photoreceptors is retinotopic; the activity of a given photoreceptor indicates light at a particular location. The receptors in the auditory system establish a spatial code that is tonotopic because of the unique properties of the cochlea. In each system, the retinotopy or tonotopy is preserved as signals are processed in secondary neurons, the thalamus, and finally in sensory cortex. The convergence of inputs from lower levels produces neurons at higher levels that have more complex response properties. Combinations of LGN inputs give rise to simple and complex receptive fields in visual cortex; similarly in the auditory system, the integration of inputs tuned to different sound frequencies yields higher level neurons that respond to complex combinations of frequencies. Another example of increasing visual complexity is the convergence of inputs from the two eyes, which yields binocular neurons that are important for depth perception. Analogously, in the auditory system, input from the two ears is combined to create binaural neurons, which are used for horizontal sound localization. These are just a few of the many similarities in the two systems. Principles governing one system can often help us understand other systems. Keep this in mind while reading about the somatic sensory system in the next chapter, and you’ll be able to predict some features of cortical organization based on the types of sensory receptors.",,,,,,,,,Cognitive Neuroscience,Neuroscience: Exploring the Brain
,,,,Spinal control of movement,,,Bear M.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"We can draw several conclusions from the preceding discussion of the spinal control of movement. First, a great deal has been learned about movement and its spinal control by working at different levels of analysis, ranging from biochemistry and genetics to biophysics and behavior. Indeed, a complete understanding, whether of excitation–contraction coupling or central pattern generation, requires knowledge derived from every approach. Second, sensation and movement are inextricably linked even at the lowest levels of the neural motor system. The normal function of the alpha motor neuron depends on direct feedback from the muscles themselves and indirect information from the tendons, joints, and skin. Third, the spinal cord contains an intricate network of circuits for the control of movement; it is far more than just a conduit for somatic sensory and motor information. Evidently, coordinated and complex patterns of activity in these spinal circuits can be driven by relatively crude descending signals. This leaves the question of precisely what the upper motor neurons contribute to motor control—the subject of the next chapter.",,,,,,,,,Cognitive Neuroscience,Neuroscience: Exploring the Brain
,,,,Brain control of movement,,,Bear M.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Let’s return to the example of the baseball pitcher one last time to put the different pieces of the motor control puzzle together. Imagine the pitcher walking to the mound. The spinal circuits of the crossed extensor reflex are engaged and coordinated by descending commands on the ventromedial pathways. Extensors contract, flexors relax; flexors contract, extensors relax. Once on the mound, the pitcher is joined by the umpire. Into his outstretched hand the umpire drops a new baseball. The added weight stretches the flexors of the arm. Group Ia axons become more active and cause monosynaptic excitation of the motor neurons innervating the flexors. The muscles contract to hold the ball up against gravity. He is now ready to pitch. His neocortex is fully engaged and active as he looks at the catcher for the hand signal that tells him the type of pitch to throw. At the same time, the ventromedial pathways are working to maintain his standing posture. Although his body is still, the neurons of the ventral horns of the spinal cord are firing steadily under the influence of the ventromedial pathways, keeping the extensors of the lower leg activated. The catcher flashes the sign for the curve ball. The sensory information is communicated from the occipital cortex to the parietal and prefrontal cortex. These regions of cortex along with area 6 begin planning the movement strategy. The batter steps up to the plate and is ready. Activity cycling through the basal ganglia increases, triggering the initiation of the pitch. In response to this input to the cerebral cortex, SMA activity increases, followed immediately by the activation of M1. Now instructions are sweeping down the axons of the lateral pathways. The cerebellum, activated by the corticopontocerebellar inputs, uses these instructions to coordinate the timing and force of the descending activity so the proper sequence of muscle contractions can occur. Cortical input to the reticular formation leads to the release of the antigravity muscles from reflex control. Finally, lateral pathway signals engage the motor neurons and interneurons of the spinal cord, which cause muscles of the arms and legs to contract. The pitcher winds up and throws. The batter swings. The ball sails over the left-field fence. The crowd jeers; the manager curses; the team owner frowns. Even as the pitcher’s cerebellum goes to work making adjustments for the next pitch, his body reacts. His face flushes; he sweats; he’s angry and anxious. But these latter reactions are not the stuff of the somatic motor system. These are topics of Part III, The Brain and Behavior.",,,,,,,,,Cognitive Neuroscience,Neuroscience: Exploring the Brain
,,,,Brain mechanisms of emotion,,,Bear M.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"We all know what emotions are—those feelings we have that we call happiness, sadness, and so on. But what exactly are those feelings? As evidenced by the diverse theories we have outlined, there is a great deal of uncertainty. More than a hundred years after the James–Lange theory was proposed, there remains controversy about the extent to which emotions cause changes in the body or bodily changes cause emotions. We do know from brain imaging studies that emotions are associated with widespread brain activation. Some of the structures involved are part of the limbic system, and other structures are not. But even with images of brain activity in various emotional states, understanding the neural basis of emotional experience is challenging. We don’t know which of the active areas are responsible for the feelings. Is it the most active area, all of the areas, or something else? What should we make of the observation that some brain structures are activated in multiple emotional states while others are more specific to particular emotions? For that matter, is it even correct to think of brain activity as reflecting feelings, or might feelings be emergent sensations based on combinations of active neurons, none of which independently signals an emotion? In this chapter, we have focused on a handful of brain structures for which there is particularly strong evidence for involvement in emotion. A way to look at our current state of understanding is that the combined lesion, stimulation, and brain imaging studies have done a good job identifying structures that are candidates for emotional processing. It will take a good deal more work to figure out what various cortical and subcortical areas contribute. Emotional experiences are the result of complex interactions among sensory stimuli, brain circuitry, past experiences, and the activity of neurotransmitter systems. In light of this complexity, we probably should not be surprised that humans exhibit a broad spectrum of emotional and mood disorders, as we will see in Chapter 22. When thinking about the neural basis of emotion, keep in mind that the structures apparently involved in emotion also have other functions. For a considerable time after Broca defined the limbic lobe, it was thought to be primarily an olfactory system. And even though our perspective has changed much since Broca’s time, parts of the brain involved in olfaction have been included in the definition of the limbic system. We will see in Chapter 24 that some of the limbic structures are also important for learning and memory. Emotions are nebulous experiences that influence our brains and behavior in many ways, so it seems logical that emotional processing should be intertwined with other brain functions.",,,,,,,,,Cognitive Neuroscience,Neuroscience: Exploring the Brain
,,,,Language,,,Bear M.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Language was one of the most important steps in human evolution. Communication between people is such a fundamental aspect of being human that it is difficult to imagine life without language. Current estimates are that the human capacity for language evolved relatively recently, around 100,000 years ago. While animals use a great diversity of sounds and behaviors to communicate, none of these come close to the elaborate and flexible system of language and speech used by humans. Aspects of language acquisition and use have been fruitfully studied in songbirds and nonhuman primates, but unlike other brain systems, the study of human language requires experiments and observations in humans. For this reason, experimental approaches are largely limited to behavioral studies of language acquisition and function, the consequences of lesions, effects of brain stimulation, and brain imaging with fMRI and PET. Even with these few techniques, however, a great deal has been learned. Consistent with the locations of sensory and motor areas in the brain, the basics of language organization can be understood. Early studies focused attention on Broca’s area, which is near the motor cortex and associated with speech production, and Wernicke’s area, which is near the auditory cortex and associated with speech comprehension. These observations are still of clinical use today. More recent research has shown that language processing is far more complex and engages far more of the brain than implied by the Wernicke–Geschwind model. Brain imaging and stimulation studies have revealed widespread brain areas in both hemispheres that are involved in language and that vary from one person to the next. From our perspective today, the complexity of language and its extensive representation in the brain are not so surprising because language involves many different components, such as understanding the basis of words in sound, the meanings of words, the grammar used to combine words into meaningful statements, naming objects, producing speech, and on and on. As in research on other brain systems for sensation, motor output, emotion, and so on, we are interested in the extent to which language processing involves a collection of interacting subsystems for different language skills. There is clearly still much to be learned. Further brain imaging studies will hopefully clarify the organization of language systems in the brain at a finer scale than was possible from studying the consequences of brain lesions and perhaps identify distinct circuits that serve different functions.",,,,,,,,,Cognitive Neuroscience,Neuroscience: Exploring the Brain
,,,,Memory Systems,,,Bear M.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Far from being a computer with fixed connections, the human brain is constantly changing as a result of experience. We use working memory to temporarily hold onto information, and the patterns of sensory input from some of our experiences are assembled into permanent engrams. As a child you learned to do a somersault, and the sequence of movements was unconsciously stored for use time after dizzying time. You learned the structure of the brain and are able to impress Aunt Tilly by making a sketch showing the location of the medulla oblongata. We cannot identify the precise neurons and synapses involved in storing nondeclarative or declarative memories, but research is moving us closer to such an understanding. We know that learning and memory involve changes widely across the brain. Structures in the medial temporal lobe and diencephalon are critical for memory consolidation, and engrams are stored in the neocortex through interactions with the hippocampus and other structures. Specifying precisely what each brain structure contributes to learning and memory continues to challenge researchers. We have seen that memories can be classified based on duration, the kind of information stored, and the brain structures involved. Early brain research relied on interpreting the effects of brain lesions on amnesia. From the case of H.M. alone, a tremendous amount was learned about memory in the human brain. The distinct types of memory, and the fact that one type can be disrupted without affecting others in amnesia, indicate that multiple brain systems are used for memory storage. More recent research uses human brain imaging and molecular genetic techniques to examine memory formation and sort out the temporal processes and multiple systems. There is even hope that one day there will be a treatment to significantly reduce the deleterious consequences of traumatic memories. In this chapter we have focused on questions about where memories are stored and how different brain structures interact. But what is the physiological basis for the memory storage? When we try to remember a phone number, an interruption can make us forget, suggesting that memories are initially held in a particularly fragile form. Long-term memory is much more robust; it can survive interruption, anesthesia, and the normal bumps and traumas of life. Because of this robustness, it is thought that memories are ultimately stored in structural brain changes. The nature of these structural changes in the brain is the subject of Chapter 25.",,,,,,,,,Cognitive Neuroscience,Neuroscience: Exploring the Brain
,,,,Molecular mechanisms of learning and memory,,,Bear M.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Learning and memory can occur at synapses. Regardless of the species, brain location, and memory type, many of the underlying mechanisms appear to be universal. Events are represented first as changes in the electrical activity of the brain, then as intracellular second messengers, and next as modifications of existing synaptic proteins. These temporary changes are converted to permanent ones, and long-term memories, by altering the structure of the synapse. In many forms of memory, this involves new protein synthesis and the assembly of new microcircuits. In other forms of memory, existing circuits may be disassembled. In either case, learning requires many of the same mechanisms that were used to refine brain circuitry during development. One universal feature is the involvement of Ca²⁺. Clearly, calcium does far more than build strong bones and teeth. Not only is it critical for neurotransmitter secretion and muscle contraction, but it is also involved in nearly every form of synaptic plasticity. Because it is a charge-carrying ion on the one hand and a potent second messenger substance on the other, Ca²⁺ has a unique ability to directly couple electrical activity with long-term changes in the brain. Can basic neuroscience research take us from ions to intelligence? From calcium to cognition? If you remember what you have learned in this textbook, and if synaptic plasticity truly is the basis of declarative memory, it would appear that the answer is yes.",,,,,,,,,Cognitive Neuroscience,Neuroscience: Exploring the Brain
,,,,The golem of prague,,,McElreath R.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This first chapter has argued for a rethinking of popular statistical and scientific philosophy. Instead of choosing among various black-box tools for testing null hypotheses, we should learn to build and analyze multiple non-null models of natural phenomena. To support this goal, the chapter introduced Bayesian inference, model comparison, multilevel models, and graphical causal models. The remainder of the book is organized into four interdependent parts. Foundational Concepts (Chapters 2 and 3): These chapters introduce Bayesian inference and the basic tools for performing Bayesian calculations. They move quite slowly and emphasize a purely logical interpretation of probability theory. Bayesian Multiple Linear Regression (Chapters 4 through 9): This section builds multiple linear regression as a Bayesian tool, supporting causal inference by analyzing separate causal models to determine which variables to include. These chapters emphasize plotting results instead of attempting to interpret estimates of individual parameters. Problems of model complexity—overfitting—also feature prominently, introducing information theory and formal model comparison in Chapter 7. Generalized Linear Models (Chapters 9 through 12): This part presents generalized linear models of several types. Chapter 9 introduces Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods used to fit the models in later chapters. Chapter 10 introduces maximum entropy as an explicit procedure to help design and interpret these models. Chapters 11 and 12 detail the models themselves. Advanced Models and Applications (Chapters 13 through 16): This section covers multilevel models, as well as specialized models addressing measurement error, missing data, and spatial correlation. This material is fairly advanced but proceeds in the same mechanistic way as earlier material. Chapter 16 departs from the rest of the book by deploying theoretical models expressed directly as statistical models, rather than generalized linear types. The final chapter, Chapter 17, returns to some of the issues raised in this first one. At the end of each chapter, there are practice problems ranging from easy to hard. These problems help you test your comprehension, with harder ones expanding on the material and introducing new examples and obstacles.",,,,,,,,,Methods,Statistical Rethinking
,,,,Small worlds and large worlds,,,McElreath R.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This chapter introduced the conceptual mechanics of Bayesian data analysis. The target of inference in Bayesian inference is a posterior probability distribution. Posterior probabilities state the relative numbers of ways each conjectured cause of the data could have produced the data. These relative numbers indicate plausibilities of the different conjectures. These plausibilities are updated in light of observations, a process known as Bayesian updating. More mechanically, a Bayesian model is a composite of variables and distributional definitions for these variables. The probability of the data, often called the likelihood, provides the plausibility of an observation (data), given a fixed value for the parameters. The prior provides the plausibility of each possible value of the parameters, before accounting for the data. The rules of probability tell us that the logical way to compute the plausibilities, after accounting for the data, is to use Bayes’ theorem. This results in the posterior distribution. In practice, Bayesian models are fit to data using numerical techniques, like grid approximation, quadratic approximation, and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Each method imposes different trade-offs.",,,,,,,,,Methods,Statistical Rethinking
,,,,Sampling the imaginary,,,McElreath R.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This chapter introduced the basic procedures for manipulating posterior distributions. Our fundamental tool is samples of parameter values drawn from the posterior distribution. Working with samples transforms a problem of integral calculus into a problem of data summary. These samples can be used to produce intervals, point estimates, posterior predictive checks, as well as other kinds of simulations. Posterior predictive checks combine uncertainty about parameters, as described by the posterior distribution, with uncertainty about outcomes, as described by the assumed likelihood function. These checks are useful for verifying that your software worked correctly. They are also useful for prospecting for ways in which your models are inadequate. Once models become more complex, posterior predictive simulations will be used for a broader range of applications. Even understanding a model often requires simulating implied observations. We’ll keep working with samples from the posterior to make these tasks as easy and customizable as possible.",,,,,,,,,Methods,Statistical Rethinking
,,,,Geocentric models,,,McElreath R.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This chapter introduced the simple linear regression model, a framework for estimating the association between a predictor variable and an outcome variable. The Gaussian distribution comprises the likelihood in such models, because it counts up the relative numbers of ways different combinations of means and standard deviations can produce an observation. To fit these models to data, the chapter introduced quadratic approximation of the posterior distribution and the tool quap. It also introduced new procedures for visualizing posterior distributions and posterior predictions. The next chapter expands on these concepts by introducing regression models with more than one predictor variable. The basic techniques from this chapter are the foundation of most of the examples in later chapters. So if much of the material was new to you, it might be worth reviewing the chapter now, before pressing onwards.",,,,,,,,,Methods,Statistical Rethinking
,,,,The many variables & the spurious waffles,,,McElreath R.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This chapter introduced multiple regression, a way of constructing descriptive models for how the mean of a measurement is associated with more than one predictor variable. The defining question of multiple regression is: What is the value of knowing each predictor, once we already know the other predictors? Implicit in this question are: (1) a focus on the value of the predictors for description of the sample, instead of forecasting a future sample; and (2) the assumption that the value of each predictor does not depend upon the values of the other predictors. In later chapters, we confront these two issues. But before that, in the next chapter, we’ll see how adding predictor variables can create as many problems as it can solve.",,,,,,,,,Methods,Statistical Rethinking
,,,,The haunted DAG & the causal terror,,,McElreath R.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Multiple regression is no oracle. It is logical, but the relationships it describes are conditional associations, not causal influences. Therefore, additional information from outside the model is needed to make sense of it. This chapter presented introductory examples of some common frustrations: multicollinearity, post-treatment bias, and collider bias. Solutions to these frustrations can be organized under a coherent framework in which hypothetical causal relations among variables are analyzed to locate and cope with confounding. In all cases, causal models exist outside the statistical model and can be difficult to test. However, it is possible to reach valid causal inferences in the absence of experiments. This is good news because we often cannot perform experiments, both for practical and ethical reasons.",,,,,,,,,Methods,Statistical Rethinking
,,,,Ulysses' Compass,,,McElreath R.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This chapter has been a marathon. It began with the problem of overfitting, a universal phenomenon by which models with more parameters fit a sample better, even when the additional parameters are meaningless. Two common tools were introduced to address overfitting: regularizing priors and estimates of out-of-sample accuracy (WAIC and PSIS). Regularizing priors reduce overfitting during estimation, and WAIC and PSIS help estimate the degree of overfitting. Practical functions in the rethinking package were introduced to help analyze collections of models fit to the same data. If you are after causal estimates, then these tools will mislead you. So models must be designed through some other method, not selected on the basis of out-of-sample predictive accuracy. But any causal estimate will still overfit the sample. So you always have to worry about overfitting, measuring it with WAIC/PSIS and reducing it with regularization.",,,,,,,,,Methods,Statistical Rethinking
,,,,Conditional Manatees,,,McElreath R.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This chapter introduced interactions, which allow for the association between a predictor and an outcome to depend upon the value of another predictor. While you can’t see them in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), interactions can be important for making accurate inferences. Interactions can be difficult to interpret, so the chapter also introduced triptych plots that help in visualizing the effect of an interaction. No new coding skills were introduced, but the statistical models considered were among the most complicated so far in the book. To go any further, we’re going to need a more capable conditioning engine to fit our models to data. That’s the topic of the next chapter.",,,,,,,,,Methods,Statistical Rethinking
,,,,Markov Chain,,,McElreath R.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This chapter has been an informal introduction to Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimation. The goal has been to introduce the purpose and approach of MCMC algorithms. The major algorithms introduced were the Metropolis, Gibbs sampling, and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithms. Each has its advantages and disadvantages. The ulam function in the rethinking package was introduced. It uses the Stan (mc-stan.org) Hamiltonian Monte Carlo engine to fit models as they are defined in this book. General advice about diagnosing poor MCMC fits was introduced by the use of a couple of pathological examples. In the next chapters, we use this new power to learn new kinds of models.",,,,,,,,,Methods,Statistical Rethinking
,,,,Big entropy and the generalized linear model,,,McElreath R.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This chapter has been a conceptual, not practical, introduction to maximum entropy and generalized linear models. The principle of maximum entropy provides an empirically successful way to choose likelihood functions. Information entropy is essentially a measure of the number of ways a distribution can arise, according to stated assumptions. By choosing the distribution with the biggest information entropy, we thereby choose a distribution that obeys the constraints on outcome variables, without importing additional assumptions. Generalized linear models arise naturally from this approach, as extensions of the linear models in previous chapters. The necessity of choosing a link function to bind the linear model to the generalized outcome introduces new complexities in model specification, estimation, and interpretation. You’ll become comfortable with these complexities through examples in later chapters.",,,,,,,,,Methods,Statistical Rethinking
,,,,God spiked the integers,,,McElreath R.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This chapter described some of the most common generalized linear models, particularly those used to model counts. It is important to never convert counts to proportions before analysis, because doing so destroys information about sample size. A fundamental difficulty with these models is that parameters are on a different scale, typically log-odds (for binomial) or log-rate (for Poisson), than the outcome variable they describe. Therefore, computing implied predictions is even more important than before.",,,,,,,,,Methods,Statistical Rethinking
,,,,Monsters and mixtures,,,McElreath R.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This chapter introduced several new types of regression, all of which are generalizations of generalized linear models (GLMs). Ordered logistic models are useful for categorical outcomes with a strict ordering. They are built by attaching a cumulative link function to a categorical outcome distribution. Zero-inflated models mix together two different outcome distributions, allowing us to model outcomes with an excess of zeros. Models for overdispersion, such as beta-binomial and gamma-Poisson, draw the expected value of each observation from a distribution that changes shape as a function of a linear model. The next chapter further generalizes these model types by introducing multilevel models.",,,,,,,,,Methods,Statistical Rethinking
,,,,Models with memory,,,McElreath R.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This chapter has been an introduction to the motivation, implementation, and interpretation of basic multilevel models. It focused on varying intercepts, which achieve better estimates of baseline differences among clusters in the data. They achieve better estimates because they simultaneously model the population of clusters and use inferences about the population to pool information among parameters. From another perspective, varying intercepts are adaptively regularized parameters, relying upon a prior that is itself learned from the data. All of this is a foundation for the next chapter, which extends these concepts to additional types of parameters and models.",,,,,,,,,Methods,Statistical Rethinking
